  ncnfall.1.t: "The Fall of New Canaan"
  ncnfall.1.d: "After two days of intense fighting, New Canaan has fallen to invading forces.  Mormon troops bravely defended the settlement until the early hours of this morning, falling back to hastily constructed defensive lines on no less than seven occasions. Whilst an order to withdraw was given late last night following a successful enemy encirclement action, the Mormon defenders of the city refused to acknowledge the order, and instead took up highly defensible positions in the centre of the settlement, where they put up a last stand throughout the night. It was only thanks to heavy ordinance that their resistance was ultimately put down. \n\nIn the morning light, it was clear the settlement had been devastated. The new occupiers spared no quarter in quashing resistance to their rule, and many building lie in smouldering ruins, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the Mormon's main place of worship."
  ncnfall.1.a: "How long can a nation stand without its namesake?"
