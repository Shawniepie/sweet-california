  nf_caf.0.d:0 "'Established in 2XXX, your friends at Costa Cafeinada has served the thirsty citizens of Mexico for over *ILLEGIBLE* years. But it's a long trip to the top, and nobody knows that like us. Why, when our cacique first founded this company it was nothing more than:"
  nf_caf.0.a:0 "A simple corner cafe, serving our special blend with a smile to our American guests"
  nf_caf.0.b:0 "A quiet transportation company, with strong 'community' ties."

  nf_caf.1.t:0 "The Taste You Can't Forget"
  nf_caf.1.d:0 "'Don't be fooled by our mascot, it's not all smiles at the Costa Cafeineda compounds. Hard work and dedication to the company are a must for all our employees. But don't let that bring you down, with a free serving of Costa's delicious in-house blend every day, you'll never feel reluctant to work again!'"
  nf_caf.1.a:0 "You'll feel as strong as a deathclaw!"
  nf_caf.1.b:0 "Have the endurance of a panthleopard!"
  nf_caf.1.c:0 "And it's all completely Free! §HTM§!"

  nf_caf.2.t:0 "Business Forecast"
  nf_caf.2.d:0 "'You too, can be a part of something special. as Costa Cafeineda prepares for another great year of financial growth and new market opportunities, whether as a prized financial partner or one of our loyal employees, together, we can build a fresher future.' \n \n \n - Costa Cafeineda 2275 Company Statement"
  nf_caf.2.a:0 "Costa: §H\"The fresh new taste of Mexico.\"§!"
  nf_caf.2.b:0 "Costa: §H\"Building a plan for the future, together.\"§!"
  nf_caf.2.c:0 "Costa: §H\"The skull you can trust.\"§!"

  nf_caf.3.t:0 "Costa Requests Military Support"
  nf_caf.3.d:0 "While our relationship with Costa Cafeineda has been...tense, over the last few years, they still remain our vassal, and we, their protector. An envoy from the compounds has asked for increased military support in the form of arms and tactics training, to bolster their inadequate forces. While it may be costly, ignoring their requests may cause them to drift away from us even further, in the event we cannot stop them."
  nf_caf.3.a:0 "If they can fight, then they can fight for us."
  nf_caf.3.b:0 "A perfunctionary military mission will suffice."
  nf_caf.3.c:0 "We don't have time for this."

  nf_caf.4.t:0 "California Dreaming"
  nf_caf.4.d:0 "Our recent trade mission to the New California Republic Has gone even better than we could of ever hoped. Our entire stock and then some was sold, and eager investors from the Boneyard have bought into company. We are, for now at least, rich!"
  nf_caf.4.a:0 "I love democracy."

  nf_caf.5.t:0 "Major Trading Success!"
  nf_caf.5.d:0 "Reports from our last trading mission have told of a stunning success. Either word-of-mouth spread quickly or our buyers were already addicted, but our sales figures have surpassed even our wildest estimates. With the amount of capital we now possess, we can fund even more trade missions in the future."
  nf_caf.5.a:0 "Capitalism, ho!"

  nf_caf.6.t:0 "Aztlan Riches"
  nf_caf.6.d:0 "Aztlan has always been one of our biggest customers for our coffee sales, but sometimes even we can be surprised by the demand they have. Our trade caravans have returned laden with Aztlan riches, and merchants from the empire have already begun placing hold orders for the next caravan."
  nf_caf.6.a:0 "Just like old times."

  nf_caf.7.t:0 "Trading Success!"
  nf_caf.7.d:0 "Our trade caravans have returned with a good success, our product has sold, return buyers have placed orders, and the wheels of business turn ever so smoother."
  nf_caf.7.a:0 "There's no business like good business."

  nf_caf.8.t:0 "Trade Mission Report"
  nf_caf.8.d:0 "Our trade caravans have returned a little lighter in pocket then we'd have hoped for, but, on the other hand, they're all still alive, so we shouldn't complain too much."
  nf_caf.8.a:0 "Every sale is a win."

  nf_caf.9.t:0 "An Altered Agreement"
  nf_caf.9.d:0 "Upon arrival in Tehuacan, our Aztlan buyers decided to conveniantly inform us that they were incapable of paying the agreed price for our product, evidently hoping to scam our traders. Things were about to get heated when one of the traders offered Aztlan military surplus as a substitute, to make up for the shortfall."
  nf_caf.9.a:0 "....Thanks? I guess?"

  nf_caf.10.t:0 "Human Capital"
  nf_caf.10.d:0 "The Guerreros of Honduras are not a rich people, but they are an incredibly violent one, and in this world, concentrated violence is worth its weight in caps. In return our latest shipment, a detachment of Guerreros mercenaries have agreed to work for Costa, as long as we provide the tools for their trade."
  nf_caf.10.a:0 "Beats caps at least."

  nf_caf.11.t:0 "Massacre at the Grijalva"
  nf_caf.11.d:0 "While our relations to the Tzotzil are ambivalent, their watchful neighbour does not take kindly to them making friends. Our recent trading mission to Tzotzil was intercepted by an Itza scouting party. The product was lost, and none of the traders survived."
  nf_caf.11.a:0 "Honestly, we should of seen this coming."

  nf_caf.12.t:0 "Friendly Competition"
  nf_caf.12.d:0 "It's always a risk to sell to the competition, especially when that competition is the cartels. Thankfully, rather than outright steal our product, the cartels gave our traders an offer they couldn't refuse: our product, for theirs."
  nf_caf.12.a:0 "Nothing wrong with a little bit of diversification."

  nf_caf.13.t:0 "Trade with Costa?"
  nf_caf.13.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, a Costa Cafeinada trade caravan has successfully made it to one of our border towns. While the patrolling guards will have to be severely punished for this lapse of vigiliance, it does raise the question of why Costa would seek to trade directly through us, rather than by proxies as previously, perhaps the Costa/Aztlan relationship is not as solid as we first thought."
  nf_caf.13.a:0 "A surpise to be sure, but a welcome one."

  nf_caf.14.t:0 "Costa Disrupts our Sea Trade!"
  nf_caf.14.d:0 "While we have never had a major naval presence, we still maintain a respectable fishing and trade industry alongside our coastlines. This industry has now been rudely disrupted by Costa trade barges, barreling through our coastal waters and capsizing any fishing boats in their way. While a minor grievance, it is frustrating that our nominal puppet could disrespect us in this way."
  nf_caf.14.a:0 "How rude."

  nf_caf.15.t:0 "Costa Dismisses our Advisors!"
  nf_caf.15.d:0 "In a display of arrogance, Costa Cafeinada has dismissed our military high command under their control. Preferring to have complete control over their military forces, our advisors have been given an unceremonious boot."
  nf_caf.15.a:0 "Their loss."

  nf_caf.20.t:0 "The Lease of Two-Harbour"
  nf_caf.20.d:0 "Recently, the Boneyard has received an influx of trade from coffee traders arriving in port from the far south of Mexico. While business has been so far smooth, if infrequent, Allgood has received an offer from the traders, asking for a naval docking lease on the Two-Harbour Islets. while their offer certainly is generous, and the islands hold almost no real value to us, concerns have been raised over the appropriateness of surrendering even a small amount of autonomy to an unknown entity."
  nf_caf.20.a:0 "More coffee for everyone!"
  nf_caf.20.b:0 "I'm more of a tea-drinker anyway."

  nf_caf.21.t:0 "The Last Port of Call"
  nf_caf.21.d:0 "Life in Arroyo is peaceful, far enough away from the interests of the NCR or the warring factions of the North, our tranquility is highly treasured. Today, this peace was disturbed by huge, foreign ships, docked in Sixes harbour. The ghouls on board claimed they were from a land far to the south, and brought gifts of food and drink to our people, in return, they asked only for the freedom to dock and rest their ships on our shores, before venturing further into the Frozen North."
  nf_caf.21.a:0 "If they come in peace, then we shall received them in kind."
  nf_caf.21.b:0 "It is too dangerous, force them to leave."

  nf_caf.22.t:0 "Arroyo Refuses"
  nf_caf.22.d:0 "Despite our generous gifts, the people of Arroyo have driven our traders from our land, not only is this a setback for our trade business, the Baron himself feels personally insulted by the actions of these upstart tribals."
  nf_caf.22.a:0 "We will show them our peaceful ways, by force!"
  nf_caf.22.b:0 "Leave them be, we can make money elsewhere."

  nf_caf.25.t:0 "The Treaty of Oaxacaca"
  nf_caf.25.d:0 "Once again, the time has come for us to renegotiate our position under the authority of the Aztalan Empire. While originally these deals were struck out of desperation and a need for protection, the current weakness of the Aztalan has let us extract more and more concessions from our 'overlords.' It is the Baron's hope that this meeting will the be last, and that Costa can once operate without the oversight of any emperor other than himself."
  nf_caf.25.a:0 "Let's wring them out for all they're worth."
  nf_caf.25.b:0 "We can afford to be fair in our dealings."

  nf_caf.26.t:0 "The Treaty of Oaxaca"
  nf_caf.26.d:0 "Once again, the time has come for us to renegotiate our protection of the Costa Cafeinada Corporation. While originally these deals were fair and beneficial, the Baron has been able to exploit our weakness in the past years, and no doubt aims to use this meeting as the final nail in the coffin of our control over Costa. We could accept the inevitable and grant Costa independence, on our own terms, or we can attempt to keep them under our thumb, but this may come back to haunt us."
  nf_caf.26.a:0 "They have proven themselves to be dependable, let them be our ally rather than our servant."
  nf_caf.26.b:0 "We don't negotiate with ghouls."

  nf_caf.27.t:0 "Aztalan Agrees to our Freedom!"
  nf_caf.27.d:0 "Having demonstrated our geniality and loyalty, the Aztalan have agreed to abandon the Treaty of Oaxacaca, in return for a mutual defense pact between us, and a continued non-compete clause with the Itza Raiders."
  nf_caf.27.a:0 "That seems reasonable."
  nf_caf.27.b:0 "They fell for for our act! Let's leave them to their demise."

  nf_caf.28.t:0 "Aztalan Refuses!"
  nf_caf.28.d:0 "The Aztalan delegation has refused to any more alterations to our relationship, violating both the spirit and the law of the treaty. The Baron is reportedly furious, and has vowed not to take this disrespect sitting down."
  nf_caf.28.a:0 "Big mistake, [ATE.getleader]."

  nf_caf.29.t:0 "Costa has refused an alliance."
  nf_caf.29.d:0 "Despite our generosity in granting them their freedom, Costa has apparently decided to leave us high and dry, leaving us without an ally or a servant. Honestly, this wasn't too unexpected, really."
  nf_caf.29.a:0 "Man, what a bunch of assholes."

  nf_caf.30.t:0 "Costa Cafeinada has cut ties!"
  nf_caf.30.d:0 "The last few months have seen an angry Costa skirt around our authority, poking and prodding us into action. While it was hoped that these annoyances would dissipate, It appears that the Baron was not bluffing, and has halted all trade flowing into Aztalan. This withdrawal has sent our economy into a tailspin, food supplies are dwindling, and panic is spreading in the streets, what do we do?"
  nf_caf.30.a:0 "Fine, let them go free."
  nf_caf.30.b:0 "We will crush this insolence!"

  nf_caf.40.t:0 "Costa Cafeinada has embargoed us!"
  nf_caf.40.d:0 "While we have little trade between Costa Cafeinada directly, the interconnected nature of Mexico's trade has made us at least somewhat reliant on their economic ties. In an unprecedented action, Costa has embargoed all ingoing trade to our nation, and has threatened economic action against any trader who does business with our empire. The resulting trade collapse has hurt our economic greatly, and will take some time before it recovers."
  nf_caf.40.a:0 "There's nothing we can do."
  nf_caf.40.b:0 "Let's put the 'War' in Trade War."

  nf_caf.50.t:0 "A Lesson Learnt"
  nf_caf.50.d:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel does not take kindly to ghouls bearing gifts, it would seem, our trade ship has returned with a skeleton crew, the only survivors after coming into contact with a Brotherhood strike party sent to ward them off."
  nf_caf.50.a:0 "wow, what a bunch of jerks."

  nf_caf.51.t:0 "Coffee Addictions"
  nf_caf.51.d:0 "Despite trade between the NCR and the southern nation of Costa Cafeinada going splendidly, concerns have been raised about the content of the coffee being sold to us. Reports have shown that the coffee appears to contain highly addictive narcotics, not to mention a whole range of incredibly irradiated base materials that cannot be healthy to drink."
  nf_caf.51.a:0 "If we ban coffee, the terrorists win."
  nf_caf.51.b:0 "Let's move to limit the flow of imports from Costa."

  nf_caf.52.t:0 "The NCR Wants To Ban Coffee!"
  nf_caf.52.d:0 "Our traders in the New California Republic have delivered dire news, there is a bill currently being moved in the NCR congress to ban the sale and purchasing of our coffee imports in the country. Apparently, the bear thinks our coffe is 'addictive' 'unhealthy' and 'contains traces of high radiation.' While this is clearly slander, we need to act fast if we want to stop our biggest customer from going cold turkey."
  nf_caf.52.a:0 "We can always sell somewhere else."
  nf_caf.52.b:0 "We can make it worth their while."

  nf_caf.53.t:0 "The Coffee ban fails!"
  nf_caf.53.d:0 "Despite impassioned lobbying by environmental and local agricultural interest groups, the Costa Coffee ban has failed to be made into law, thanks in part to the vigorous campaigning of Costa's main beneficiary in the NCR, 'Allgood' Murphy and the Boneyard, who's economic growth will continue to grow from Costa's trade."
  nf_caf.53.a:0 "A little coffee never hurt anyone."
