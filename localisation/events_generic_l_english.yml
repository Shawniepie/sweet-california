  generic.170.t:0 "[From.GetName] got a Virus"
  generic.170.d:0 "[From.GetRank] [From.GetName] is suffering from a fork bomb after an error in [From.GetHerHis] programming; [From.GetSheHe] will be unable to start up new combat processes until [From.GetSheHe]'s completed a full reboot. We suspect that due to the bad climate in [From.GetHerHis] operational area, the [From.GetRank]’s circuitry was damaged by condensation, prompting the glitch. Strangely, these errors intensified after an unknown technician named \"Todd\" completed repairs - stating that the robot should now 'just work'."
  generic.170.a:0 "Have you tried turning it OFF and ON again?"

  generic.180.t:0 "[From.GetName] is Critically Damaged"
  generic.180.d:0 "After a prolonged bout of combat, [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] returned to the camp suffering heavy damage. Many of [From.GetHerHis] critical components were blown out, and the [From.GetRank]’s structural integrity is incredibly low. [From.GetName] was fortunate to return in a working condition, and will need to undergo extensive repairs before [From.GetSheHe] is capable of full operation once more."
  generic.180.a:0 "That's a Lotta Damage!"
