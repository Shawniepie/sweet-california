 ncr-boswar.1.d:0 "Recently an NCR patrol found a large group of Brotherhood soldiers and scribes inhabiting a building in the heart of the Boneyard. Attempts to figure out what they're doing have been fruitless. When asked to leave, they declined - violently. Already a few NCR soldiers have died for "trespassing", and we're reaching a breaking point."

 ncr-boswar.2.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning a man approached the sealed doors of one of our bunkers near NCR territory. He claims to be a messenger sent by the Californian brass, and so we took his message and told him to await our reply. The NCR are accusing us of sending a Brotherhood patrol to the Boneyard, without their permission. They made it especially clear that the patrol has already killed many NCR soldiers."

 ncr-boswar.3.d:0 "A month ago a large group of our soldiers went missing with a small contingent of Scribes. After much searching we finally found them thanks to a distress signal. We arrived at the scene of a bloody battle, with laser burns and bullet holes across the entire building. We searched the ruin for any signs of technology, or survivors, and found nothing... nothing except a few pairs of NCR dogtags lost under the rubble."

 ncr-boswar.4.d:0 "Our messenger has come back to us shaken, but unharmed. The message he carries from the Brotherhood is blunt and to the point. "Our soldiers were acting without orders, they must have gone AWOL over something important." Whether we believe them or not, one thing is certain: the Brotherhood soldiers we found were in a West-Tek facility."

 ncr-boswar.5.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson was reaching a breaking point, but one of the senators, a man by the name of Sean All-Good Murphy stepped in to calm the President."
 ncr-boswar.5.a:0 "Send him to the Brotherhood"
 
 ncr-boswar.6.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.6.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson crushed the message in the ball of his fist in rage. The audacity!"
 ncr-boswar.6.a:0 "Mobilise the army!"
 
 ncr-boswar.7.t:0 "Scouting Party Returns"
 ncr-boswar.7.d:0 "We've received word from our AWOL soldiers that the NCR allowed them to leave the Boneyard without complications. Supposedly they're bringing some seven holotapes of unknown value back with them; but since they're from a West-Tek facility they will be invaluable to our efforts to understand and preserve technology."
 ncr.boswar.7.a:0 "Punish them for acting without orders"
 
 ncr-boswar.8.t:0 "The Ultimatum"

 ncr-boswar.8.a:0 "Pay the compensation"
 ncr-boswar.8.b:0 "Compensation? For what?"
 
 ncr-boswar.9.t:0 "All-Good Returns"
 ncr-boswar.9.d:0 "Our demands have not gone unnoticed. The NCR have sent All-Good to speak with us once again. As ever he came to us nervous but undaunted, and we began to discuss the current situation. Sean stresses that he was only barely able to keep the NCR from declaring all-out war for our "hubris" and seeks to find a compromise. "
 ncr-boswar.9.a:0 "We must find a peaceful solution"
 ncr-boswar.9.b:0 "We must have our men returned"
 
 ncr-boswar.10.t:0 "All-Good Murphy"
 ncr-boswar.10.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson flew into a fit of fury, but a senator by the name of Sean Murphy stepped forward to calm him. This man, "All-Good", proposed simply letting the soldiers go. He knows the Brotherhood, and made a convincing argument that open conflict would put the NCR through a gauntlet it could entirely avoid."
 ncr-boswar.10.a:0 "We can't risk a war"
 
 ncr-boswar.11.t:0 "Brotherhood Refusal"
 ncr-boswar.11.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson is outraged at the continued audacity of the Brotherhood, and nobody steps forward to offer any kind of alternatives."
 ncr-boswar.11.a:0 "To hell with diplomacy!"
 
 ncr-boswar.12.t:0 "Successful Mission"
 ncr-boswar.12.d:0 "All-Good returned from the Brotherhood optimistically. They're willing to find a compromise to the issue as long as it's reasonable, and Sean is telling us to take them up on this offer. He suggests we ask the Brotherhood to detain their soldiers who killed our soldiers, for a number of years they find reasonable, and they can keep the rest. All we need, he says, is justice for our dead soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.12.a:0 "Hopefully the Brotherhood keep their end"
 ncr-boswar.12.b:0 "No repercussions? To hell with that!"
 
 ncr-boswar.13.t:0 "Diplomacy Wins Out"
 ncr-boswar.13.d:0 "We've received word that the Brotherhood have sentenced the soldiers responsible for killing our men. Five years for one man, and two for the other three. The Brotherhood have sent a formal thank you to us for allowing them to carry out the sentence."
 ncr-boswar.13.a:0 "The sentences are too short, but at least we avoided more bloodshed"
 
 ncr-boswar.14.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down"
 ncr-boswar.14.d:0 "Negotiations have broken down with the NCR. All-Good sent us a message ahead of time informing us of the worst, and the Elders are demanding the NCR be silenced once and for all."

 hooverdam.9.d:0 "Our Legions held Bonelli Landing in spectacular form, and the NCR's forces were completely destroyed.

 nf_ncr.2.t:0 "~The Baja Blues~"
 nf_ncr.2.d:0 " In the year 2256, the NCR Colony of Rattletail was established in the northern portion of Baja California by some volunteer colonists, who advanced with formal funding and merit from the NCR, but with little to no supervision or military protection. This choice would prove almost fatal for the young colonists, who elected to, by force, take control over the primary water source in the region, a fact that they were ignorant to at the time.                                                                                                                                         The locals retaliated against the small settlement, due in part to desperation, and launched two major assaults against the township, both of which were stopped with relative ease. It was the intervention and wisdom of a young Ranger, named Hanlon, that ended the dispute before the tole of the conflict became notable. The man crafted a clever lie, spouting nonsense about an arm of raiders that would soon come and wipe the down away. The colonists evacuated, the locals regained their water-supply, and greater conflict was avoided.                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately, this lie had an unintended result. It implanted, in the locals, the notion that the NCR was afraid of raiders, slavers, and the other violent sort. The locals of Baja have had almost a decade to prepare for the return of the NCR, and in preparation for that coming, they have adopted a violent, cruel lifestyle. Baja is now home to an up and coming Mexican Cartel, one that will be almost impossible to dislodge without violence. The path into the future is a complicated one, and there are only a handful of men in the NCR who have the potential to deal with this problem. Who do you appoint to oversee the handling of Baja the Baja Frontier?"

 nf_ncr.3.t:0 "~The Baron's War!~"
 nf_ncr.3.d:0 "  There is no misunderstanding within the NCR as to which border is the weakest, for the northern lands of the NCR haven't seen large-scale military action or involvement since the NCR-80's War, almost ten years ago. It was during this time that many vulnerabilities within the NCR became clear, not the least of which was the substantial time it can take for the NCR to mobilize and move its military north.                                                                                                                                                                                    When faced with the realization that the NCR's military was largely incapable of protecting or patrolling the rural northern reaches of the nation, the many influential and wealthy Brahmin Baron's took to protecting their own property with private military forces. Dozens and sometimes hundreds of mercenaries, being paid to patrol acres of grazing land, and to fight off rustlers. While initially harmless, the situation has grown more dangerous in recent years, as Baron's have taken to engaging in endless skirmishes with one another for land Brahmin, while using their political clout to keep local law enforcement off their backs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             And yet something has happened that no amount of clout can hide. The Poker family, a group of Baron's past their prime, openly murdered their prime rivals on the streets of Sacramento in a gunfight involving no fewer than fifty men and resulted in numerous civilian casualties. This event ignited a powder keg of infight among the Baron's, who now sent thousands of mercenaries to raid each other's holdings in the countryside and in various towns. Dozens of civilians have died, and an unprecedented amount of property damage has been dealt. What's more, the flow of food to the densely populated urban regions of the NCR has all but stopped. This is a disaster that must be brought under control before starvation sets in."

In an attempt to bring an end to the chaos, many powerful NCR politicians and military commanders have formed an emergency council to handle the situation. Yet even now the council has fallen to infighting, with the two most powerful political figures present, Anton I. Flynn and Sean "Allgood" Murphy clashing during every encounter. Flynn believes that the easiest method of dealing with the situation is to simply hire the mercenaries employed by all Baron's and to redistribute the land of the more violent Barons to loyal ones, such as himself. Murphy, however, believe's that this is simply a power play on Flynn's part, and thinks the answer lies with outside help. Namely, the Brotherhood of Steel, who used to patrol and protect the region. The Military commanders present aren't fond of either plan and even now, consider ignoring the council to take decisive action."
