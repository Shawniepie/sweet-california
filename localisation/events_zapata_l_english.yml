  nf_zap.1.t:0 "Better to Die On Your Feet Than Live On Your Knees"
  nf_zap.1.d:0 "Emiliano Zapata was a hero of the Mexican Revolution, an advocate for land reform, equality for all Mexicans, and democracy. Naturally he was a symbol to many who resisted America's prewar occupation, and most of Tlaloc's image of this man was filtered through this lens.

How did he pursue that?"
  nf_zap.1.a:0 "He gave land to those who worked it with their hands."
  nf_zap.1.b:0 "He recognizes that justice comes from a rifle in one's hands."
