 ALA_our_founding:0 "Our Founding"
 ALA_our_founding_desc:0 "While High Elder Maxson was the founder of the Brotherhood as a whole, each chapter has had its own founders, those that spread the word of the dangers of technology farther into the Wasteland. Who were our founders?"

 ALA_our_interim:0 "Our Interim"
 ALA_our_interim_desc:0 "Each chapter of the Brotherhood has its own priorities. Some focus on collecting the powerful weapons of the Old World, while some prioritise the industrial machinery and tools. What did we focus on?"

 ALA_our_future:0 "Our Future"
 ALA_our_future_desc:0 "We have learned plenty in the years that are now behind us. We must now use that experience and make preparations for the many years that are in front of us."

 ALA_water_operations:0 "Water Operations"
 ALA_water_operations_desc:0 "With secure access to a large body of water, we can begin to expand our operations to a naval theatre. Although we have little to no experience in such matters, we can look to pre-war tactics for guidance."

 ALA_port_expansion:0 "Port Expansion"
 ALA_port_expansion_desc:0 "In order to host a fleet of operational size we require numerous facilities, such as dry docks, maintenance yards, piers, etc. In order to accomplish our goals we'll need to invest heavily in the expansion of our existing naval infrastructure."

 ALA_supporting_vessels:0 "Sea Raiders"
 ALA_supporting_vessels_desc:0 "Smaller and lighter craft make up the bulk of modern wasteland navies. To keep our edge in the seas we must invest in the production of simple, robust crafts, who can harass enemy vessels with ease."

 ALA_larger_vessels:0 "Siege Ships"
 ALA_larger_vessels_desc:0 "In order to make any kind of dent in an enemy navy, and to effectively support our troops on the shore, we need to be capable of building large ships capable of mounting large weaponry. Focusing on this will bring us closer to naval domination."

 ALA_reclaim_a_flagship:0 "Reclaim a Flagship"
 ALA_reclaim_a_flagship_desc:0 "Power projection is everything. In order to truly make our mark on the seas we cannot simply have an effective navy: we must also have an impressive one. A refitted flagship of the old world would suit our needs nicely."

 ALA_aerial_operations:0 "Aerial Operations"
 ALA_aerial_operations_desc:0 "Flexibility is something our organisation often lacks. In order to account for our weaknesses we must turn them into strengths. In the past, vast expeditions have been undertaken with the aid of aerial equipment. We can learn from this."

 ALA_from_the_skies:0 "From The Skies"
 ALA_from_the_skies_desc:0 "Although we possess the knowledge to retrofit the most basic of aircraft, we have no knowledge on how to pilot them in combat, or how to utilise them tactically. We should turn to our databases and adapt as much information on pre-war air tactics as we can"

 ALA_staging_bases:0 "Staging Bases"
 ALA_staging_bases_desc:0 "Aircraft are oversized paperweights without the proper facilities to maintain and arm them, and enough open space to take off and land. If we want to develop an effective air force we need to scout for ideal locations to create airfields, and do just that."

 ALA_aerial_supremacy:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
 ALA_aerial_supremacy_desc:0 "With our newfound understanding of ariel combat, we can begin to redesign our planes with the wasteland in mind. Cutting corners where possible will save us a lot of production time and valuable resources, both of which are things in scarce supply currently."

 ALA_flight_academy:0 "Brotherhood Flight Academy"
 ALA_flight_academy_desc:0 "Pilots are the lifeblood of an air force, and our pilots need to make effective use of our limited supply of planes, ammunition, and equipment. Establishing a thorough training programme for pilots will not only make better use of our equipment, but it may provide us with a genuine ace."

 ALA_our_right:0 "Our Right"
 ALA_our_right_desc:0 "As a technocratic organisation, every piece of tech is rightfully ours. We do not steal technology out of malice or spite, we take it away to protect the innocents who will inevitably misuse it. Although people don't always understand, everything we do is ultimately to keep the wasteland safe. Our understanding of technology is second to none."

 ALA_salvaged_metal:0 "Salvaged Metal"
 ALA_salvaged_metal_desc:0 "Metal salvage is easy to come by. Twisted scraps of metal are as common as dirt in the wasteland, protruding from buildings, buried in the earth like weeds, and strewn across streets like rubbish. Salvaging the metal in our immediate area will provide us with more resources for our equipment."

 ALA_increase_power_production:0 "Increase Power Production"
 ALA_increase_power_production_desc:0 "Generators are both a blessing and a curse. They create large amounts of power for relatively low maintenance cost, but they often require specific fuel cells and are difficult to redesign to run off of corn fuel. Investing in power generation will always benefit our equipment output."

 ALA_salvaged_electronics:0 "Salvaged Electronics"
 ALA_salvaged_electronics_desc:0 "Salvaging electronics is much more difficult than salvaging metal, in part due to the delicate nature of most electronics. At best, pulling the wiring and circuitry from radios, robots, and broken energy weapons will provide us with more scrap electronics for future projects."

 ALA_advanced_tech:0 "Advanced Tech"
 ALA_advanced_tech_desc:0 "Gathering rare technology is not only difficult, but dangerous. Often, the locations where rare pre-war technology can be found are also filled with killer robots, deadly radiation, or other hazards. Still, gathering advanced tech will allow us to create numerous high-end pieces of equipment, so it must be done."

 ALA_fueling_our_rise:0 "Fueling Our Rise"
 ALA_fueling_our_rise_desc:0 "Fuel comes in all forms, but often our scavenging parties search for the nuclear variety. Unspent fuel cells are incredibly valuable to everyone in the wasteland, but especially to us. They power our power armour, our gatling lasers, and our generators. Securing them is a high priority for all scouts."

 ALA_arm_foundries:0 "Arms Foundries"
 ALA_arm_foundries_desc:0 "We cannot spread and uphold our doctrine without force, and we cannot apply force effectively if our men are undersupplied. If the Brotherhood is to continue its operations, we must not only take technology from the hands of settlers, but produce it ourselves."

 ALA_civilian_workshops:0 "Civilian Workshops"
 ALA_civilian_workshops_desc:0 "Many of the bunkers and bases we seek to occupy were not left untouched by the Great War, and they require extensive repairs and excavation efforts to become fully usable. To ensure that we're prepared for future construction efforts, we should begin to develop a small industrial base of our own."

 ALA_heavy_production:0 "Heavy Production"
 ALA_heavy_production_desc:0 "With our civilian and military industry projects finished we're seeing our efforts pay off hand over fist. In order to continue to foster success and fuel our growth, we should launch a second, smaller construction effort, focusing on a mixture of both branches. Alongside this, we can set up infrastructure for future efforts, also."

 ALA_our_might:0 "Our Might"
 ALA_our_might_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel is feared and respected throughout the wasteland for our military might. In terms of combat effectiveness, we are high above the dregs the wasteland has to offer. One man in power armour is worth ten unarmoured soldiers, if not more. Studying previous engagements will help us improve our future combat doctrine."

 ALA_steel_legions:0 "Steel Legions"
 ALA_steel_legions_desc:0 "Standing side by side our men form a wall of unbreakable strength. The Brotherhood is like one long chain, spread out across the continent, which many, many links throughout its length. No part of the Brotherhood is weak, every man and woman is trained to a level of proficiency other groups can only dream of."

 ALA_new_initiates:0 "New Initiates"
 ALA_new_initiates_desc:0 "We're more than just a military organisation, the Brotherhood is one large family. Our knights, paladins, and scribes are all free to pursue relationships, marry, and have children. This is how the Brotherhood survives. When these children come of age, they become initiates, and start their training for their respective discipline."

 ALA_t45d_production:0 "T-45d Production"
 ALA_t45d_production_desc:0 "T-45d was the first model of power armour produced by America, and it shows. A simple frame, lacklustre servos, exposed weak points and a less than impressive helmet design. Still, any power armour is better than none, and its simplicity makes it faster to fix and produce."

 ALA_t51b_production:0 "T-51b Production"
 ALA_t51b_production_desc:0 "The pinnacle of pre-war power armour design, the T-51b model is a favourite among the Brotherhood of Steel for its robust design, shaped ceramic armour, lack of clear weak points, and expertly crafted helmet and filters. Although harder to maintain and produce, there's no doubt that T-51b is superior to T-45d in every way."

 ALA_wastelander_conscripts:0 "Wastelander Conscripts"
 ALA_wastelander_conscripts_desc:0 "Wastelanders are a dime a dozen, with little special or unique about them. Often short sighted, brutish, and too simple to understand the danger of technology: we often avoid them like the plague. Still, sometimes, new blood is required. At times like these, we hunt the population for worthy candidates, often accepting proven and friendly wastelanders into our ranks."

 ALA_flesh_before_steel:0 "Flesh Before Steel"
 ALA_flesh_before_steel_desc:0 "\"The flesh is weak,\" a common phrase with a vastly different meaning to others than to us. In the Brotherhood, this phrase is said to express and accept that the human body is frail. Even with our power armour we are still human, and unless the body inside the armour has been trained properly, it will die off long before the armour breaks. All initiates are trained to understand this: weakness is human."

 ALA_basic_arms_for_basic_people:0 "Basic Arms for Basic People"
 ALA_basic_arms_for_basic_people_desc:0 "Even wastelanders recruited into our ranks cannot be expected to understand technology as well as we do. In order to prevent any unfortunate accidents, we provide wasteland recruits with simpler energy weapons until they've proven themselves capable. Naturally, this means we produce and salvage many weapons ahead of time for new recruits."

 ALA_doctrinal_thought:0 "Doctrinal Thought"
 ALA_doctrinal_thought_desc:0 "With new blood comes new ideas. Wastelanders think and fight a different way to the Brotherhood, and this experience often proves valuable for the Brotherhood as a whole. By making our wasteland initiates compose reports of their previous battles, we can examine them to gauge the state of the wasteland, and prepare accordingly."

 ALA_combined_operations:0 "Combined Operations"
 ALA_combined_operations_desc:0 "Learning to fight alongside former wastelanders can be difficult. Their wild, survivalist minded style of combat can often be hectic and unpredictable. This is precisely why recruiting them can be so valuable, and why fitting them into our command structure is so beneficial. That wild, unpredictable nature only makes our squads more effective than before."

 ALA_our_goal:0 "Our Goal"
 ALA_our_goal_desc:0 "The Brotherhood's ideology is straight forward. We desire a world in which the recklessness of man cannot be enabled by the tools he wields, a world in which atrocities aren't committed for the sake of \"scientific progress.\" This is why we confiscate technology, and destroy that which we cannot confiscate. All of our duties are for the good of mankind as a whole."

 ALA_seek_technology:0 "Technological Study"
 ALA_seek_technology_desc:0 "Replicating the electronics of the pre-war is a difficult task, even for the simplest of designs. If we want to have any hope of reliably recreating somewhat advanced designs, we need to dissect our precious few working pre-war models and examine their inner workings. It's painful, but unless we can figure out the secret behind these things, we'll forever be in the dark."

 ALA_scribe_research:0 "Scribe Research"
 ALA_scribe_research_desc:0 "Pushing our scribes towards longer research projects will inevitably reward us. Prioritising long term study and self reflection should make our results more accurate, and having scribes accompany scouting squads should make them much more capable of investigating pre-war sites. Scribes are the backbone of the Brotherhood, we must continue to hone their skills."

 ALA_old_developments:0 "Old Developments"
 ALA_old_developments_desc:0 "Pre-war technology is inherently valuable, even if it's broken and only pure scrap. Scouring pre-war ruins for undiscovered rare technology, whether broken or somewhat working, is an important part of the Brotherhood's operations in the wasteland."

 ALA_robotic_advancements:0 "Robotic Advancements"
 ALA_robotic_advancements_desc:0 "Robotics was one of America's largest industries before the Great War, and it was considered a world leaser in the field of robotics. As a result of this the wasteland is scattered with the shells of broken robots, as well as the roaming figures of those still following outdated programming. Taking both apart will aid us in building robots for our own ends."

 ALA_vertibird_schematics:0 "Vertibird Schematics"
 ALA_vertibird_schematics_desc:0 "The most prized of all pre-war schematics, the schematics for Vertibirds are rare and difficult to come across. All known copies have only ever come from the Enclave, and with their demise this precious supply has dried up. Still, former Enclave technicians who escaped their demise often take many tools with them... and sometimes, a schematic or two."

 ALA_bunker_thought:0 "Bunker Mindset"
 ALA_bunker_thought_desc:0 "Almost all members of the Brotherhood were born in a bunker, and most of us spent our lives growing up in and around them. For us, the safety of a bunker reassuring and comforting. As a result, Brotherhood fortifications are built to a higher standard than most others, due to our familiarity with reinforced structures."

 ALA_surface_outposts:0 "Surface Outposts"
 ALA_surface_outposts_desc:0 "In order to expand our operations farther and farther, we require secure facilities to store supplies and rest between expeditions. Establishing a construction corps specifically for the purpose of building surface fortifications would benefit us greatly."

 ALA_underground_workshops:0 "Underground Workshops"
 ALA_underground_workshops_desc:0 "Expanding our industrial base inside of our bunker network is our next priority. Setting up industry within fortified positions will allow us to continue to create a respectable output even while on the back foot, effectively creating a layer of industry that our enemy cannot take until the very end."

 ALA_new_technology:0 "Technological Breakthrough"
 ALA_new_technology_desc:0 "Our scribes have made a series of significant scientific discoveries in rapid succession, broadening our horizons and impacting all of our current research projects from the ground up. This is truly incredible, as these teachings will allow us to pursue our research and restoration projects faster than ever before."

 ALA_tesla_theory:0 "Tesla Theory"
 ALA_tesla_theory_desc:0 "With our new breakthroughs in the field of science, our scribes have been able to recreate a pre-war schematic we found long ago. Formerly, we were incapable of reproducing its effects without disastrous results. Now, however, we've finally managed to stabilise the design enough for combat use. Tesla weaponry has been added to our armouries!"

 # Washington Brotherhood #

 ALA_within_the_blizzard:0 "Within The Blizzard"
 ALA_within_the_blizzard_desc:0 "Within the perpetual snow of the north, there's a city unlike any other: a city inhabited by ghosts. They say that if you step foot in their city you never return. Those vengeful spirits loathe the living, their eyes burn like orange coals of distorted desire. Dragging you deep, deep into their dark heart, they make you one of them."

 ALA_sinister_patriots:0 "Sinister Patriots"
 ALA_sinister_patriots_desc:0 "\"The north is where men lose their sense,\" that's what they say. Stubborn prospectors who ignore danger, foolish youths following dreams of spun silver, and desperate men with nothing left to lose: these are the pilgrims of the north. Their one and only port of call before the Endless White is the Old Country, a nation of pre-war Ghouls who long for the days of yore."

 ALA_fellow_savages:0 "Fellow Savages"
 ALA_fellow_savages_desc:0 "Traders who brave the northern seas are as likely to curse Port Maw as they are to praise it. Small vessels are often molested in the open waters by pirates from Port Maw, their crews killed and their goods stolen. In darker corners of the port, pirates whisper about their dealings with ghosts. Slaves for guns, shiny things for lasers. Supposedly, one man even fished up an obelisk for them..."

 ALA_dark_ambitions:0 "Dark Ambitions"
 ALA_dark_ambitions_desc:0 "Sealed inside his armour, the Immortal has been leading his men since their days in the Midwestern Brotherhood. If his former Elder saw who he was today, he would be put down on the spot. The Immortal knows that he's been warped, changed, hollowed out. He doesn't lament what he's lost, and neither do the men who've followed him. They all know in their hearts that today's evil is tomorrow's good."

 ALA_enslave_the_weak:0 "Enslave The Weak"
 ALA_enslave_the_weak_desc:0 "Tribal families make excellent workers, that's what the Washington Brotherhood decided soon after they'd wrested control of Seattle from the few dregs inhabiting it. If they wanted to restore the city and its facilities to their former glory they'd need workers... workers who wouldn't complain, who couldn't complain. Slavery is just another mean towards their end: morality is worthless."

 ALA_expand_our_dominion:0 "Expand Our Dominion"
 ALA_expand_our_dominion_desc:0 "It's not enough for the Brotherhood to simply rest in their citadel buried in the heart of Seattle. They need more: more slaves, more resources, more facilities... more more more. That's what the Immortal tells his men, it's what he mumbles to himself every day. More. The engines of war are turning again, because the Immortal demands it."

 ALA_eradicate_the_mutants:0 "Eradicate The Mutants"
 ALA_eradicate_the_mutants_desc:0 "The Immortal might be a ghoul but he has no sympathy for his kind. Ferals must die, as must super mutants. Troll Warren has long been a bastion for super mutants wandering the north, and their 'civilzation' now controls enough territory to be a credible threat to our populations on the border. We too now control great expanses of territory, and possess a formidable armed force. The north must be wiped clean of scum before the real work can begin. This isn't genocide: it's mercy."

 ALA_black_paladins:0 "Black Paladins"
 ALA_black_paladins_desc:0 "Enslaving the weak and putting them to work isn't enough, we need to police them too. The strongest are picked to keep their brethren in line, and slowly but surely they begin to slip into our grasp. Once they're cruel and broken we take them into our ranks, burning the seal into their flesh. Black Paladins of the Washington Brotherhood are truly a terribly sad thing."

 ALA_decimate_and_despoil:0 "Decimate And Despoil"
 ALA_decimate_and_despoil_desc:0 "Mercy isn't a virtue, it's a weakness. The Immortal taught us this during the long journey to Seattle, he showed us the true path, a path of suffering and victory. All who cannot be forced to work must be purged. There's no room for compassion in this frozen wasteland."

 ALA_dark_foundries:0 "Dark Foundries"MOJ_ncr_raids
 ALA_dark_foundries_desc:0 "Deep within our facility lies an infernal machine whose engine burns like spent fire. It desires blood and coal. We will build a great cathedral of wrought iron and bloody furnaces to wake its slumbering heart, so that it may gaze upon our desecration and reward us justly."

 ALA_death_or_glory:0 "Death Or Glory"
 ALA_death_or_glory_desc:0 "We came to the north knowing that our lives were forfeit, that there was no turning back once we left our former chapter. Seattle is a harsh mistress, her frosts threaten to destroy your servos and chill your bones - but her cold touch preserves the lost world. We have nothing left to lose, and everything left to gain."

 ALA_alaskan_expedition:0 "Great Alaskan Expedition"
 ALA_alaskan_expedition_desc:0 "Finally. Finally it's time to fulfil the Immortal's dream. Our scouts have been scouring Alaska for his objective, and they found it. Buried into the side of a mountain, covered in ice, a bulkhead waits to be opened. It's time to send an expedition to reclaim that lost place."
 
 ALA_establishingsupplylines:0 "Establishing Supply Lines "
 ALA_establishingsupplylines_desc:0 "Our Chapter is newly very newly established and is in a rather weak position as we are heavily understaffed and underequipped to make things worse the terrain of this godforsaken island is taking its toll on our equipment which is continuously breaking down. If we were to repair the supply lines between our newly established outposts we will be capable of ensuring our soldiers do not experience attrition."
 
 ALA_requestsupportfromcommand:0 "Request Support From Command"
 ALA_requestsupportfromcommand_desc:0 "With our Supply Lines repaired and our situation on this island more solid we are now in a position to request resources from command to ensure we can hold this rock."
 
 ALA_prewarinstallations:0 "Repair Pre-War Military Installations"
 ALA_prewarinstallations_desc:0 "During the Sino-American War Haida became a major military Foward Operating Base during the United States reclamation of Alaska"
 
  ALA_repairthefleet:0 "Repair The Fleet"
ALA_repairthefleet_desc:0 "When the Great War occurred a large portion of the United States 11th Fleet regrouped at Mores Harbor however it would appear these great warships never left their ports. Although the larger ships are all capsized and destroyed they there are several smaller ships that we could repair. "

ALA_manpowercrisis:0 "Solving Our Manpower Crisis"
ALA_manpowercrisis_desc:0 "Due to our Chapter's consistant manpower issues we have no choice but to begin recruitment wastelanders within our territories to ensure our manpower crisis is solved."

ALA_enviroment:0 "Learning The Enviroment"
ALA_enviroment_desc:0 "The Enviroment in Haida is tough to say the least however since we landed in Haida we have managed to learn the enviroment which has allowed our forces to survive effectively within this harsh landscape."

ALA_extensivetraining:0 "Extensive Training Drills"
ALA_extensivetraining_desc:0 "Due to our Chapters low manpower we have no choice but to ensure that our soldiers are the best in the wastes and as such our soldiers will undergo the most comprehensive training drills in the wastes."

ALA_ChoosingOurTarget:0 "Choosing Our Target"
ALA_ChoosingOurTarget_desc:0 "With our Chapter effectively having a foothold within our territories we are now in a position to begin offensive operations against our enemies. That is of course if Headquarters approves of this operation."

ALA_integratingvictoria:0 "Integrate Victoria"
ALA_integratingvictoria_desc:0 "With New Victoria under our solid control we are now capable of integrating their territories into our Chapter which will allow us to in turn mass recruit the populace of New Victoria"

ALA_integratingbrk:0 "Integrate Broken Coast"
ALA_integratingbrk_desc:0 "With Broken Coast under our solid control we are now capable of integrating their territories into our Chapter which will allow us to in turn mass recruit the populace of Broken Coast"
