 # Decisions #
  scavenge_resources: "Scavenging for Equipment"
  scavenge_resources_desc: "Producing our equipment is all well and good, but the wasteland is also a treasure trove of equipment waiting to be discovered. However, this equipment is often hidden, guarded, and perilous to recover. We can send out search parties to find equipment in the wastes (risking their lives in the process) at the expense of some political power. Hopefully our men will return with what we asked for.\n\nOur scavenging efficiency affects our chances to find equipment - currently §R[?Root.scavenge_efficiency]%§! \nIt is increased by technological advances (which require the §HRoll Out Technology to Scavengers§! decision after the relevant research) and by your nation type.\nIf you find the window too cluttered, use the §HScavenging Options§! decision to cut it down."

  begin_scavenging_program: "Begin a Scavenging Program"
  begin_scavenging_program_desc: "Whilst scavenging for resources has been done in the past, we should begin a comprehensive scavenging program of dedicated scavengers. We can send them out to look for specific types of equipment - what we can send them out for depends on our country's technology."

  scavenge_equip: "Scavenge for Equipment"
  scavenge_equip_desc: "Send out our scavengers to find equipment for our troops - guns, melee weapons, armour and support equipment. The equipment and its quantity depends on our scavenging efficiency.\n\nOur Scavenging Efficiency does not affect the chance of each event firing, but does affect the quality and quantity of loot we get from the event."

  scavenge_equip_pa: "Scavenge for Equipment using Power Armour"
  scavenge_equip_pa_desc: "Send out our scavengers suited up in power armour to find equipment for our troops. Sending them out in power armour increases our scavengers chance of survival, but will otherwise not impact the time or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard equipment mission."

  scavenge_equip_motor: "Scavenge for Equipment using Vehicles"
  scavenge_equip_motor_desc: "Send out our scavengers in our latest motor equipment - motorbikes, cars or trucks. Sending them this way will decrease the time the mission takes, but will otherwise not impact on their mortality rate or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard equipment mission."

  scavenge_equip_fly: "Scavenge for Equipment using Vertibirds"
  scavenge_equip_fly_desc: "Send out our scavengers in Vertibirds to find equipment for our troops. Sending them this way will significantly decrease the time the mission takes, but will otherwise not impact on their mortality rate or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard equipment mission."

  scavenge_robots: "Scavenge for Robots"
  scavenge_robots_desc: "Send out our scavengers to find robots - both whole robots ready to be reprogrammed and robot parts that our people back home can tinker about with and repair. The robots and their quantity depends on our scavenging efficiency.\n\nOur Scavenging Efficiency does not affect the chance of each event firing, but does affect the quality and quantity of loot we get from the event."

  scavenge_robots_pa: "Scavenge for Robots using Power Armour"
  scavenge_robots_pa_desc: "Send out our scavengers suited up in power armour to find robots for our troops. Sending them out in power armour increases our scavengers chance of survival, but will otherwise not impact the time or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard robots mission."

  scavenge_robots_motor: "Scavenge for Robots using Vehicles"
  scavenge_robots_motor_desc: "Send out our scavengers in our latest motor equipment - motorbikes, cars or trucks.

  scavenge_robots_fly: "Scavenge for Robots using Vertibirds"
  scavenge_robots_fly_desc: "Send out our scavengers in Vertibirds to find robots for our troops. Sending them this way will significantly decrease the time the mission takes, but will otherwise not impact on their mortality rate or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard robots mission."

  scavenge_vehicles: "Scavenge for Vehicles"
  scavenge_vehicles_desc: "Send out our scavengers to find vehicles - motorbikes, cars and maybe even the odd truck or old-world APC. The vehicles and their quantity depends on our scavenging efficiency.\n\nOur Scavenging Efficiency does not affect the chance of each event firing, but does affect the quality and quantity of loot we get from the event."

  scavenge_vehicles_pa: "Scavenge for Vehicles using Power Armour"
  scavenge_vehicles_pa_desc: "Send out our scavengers suited up in power armour to find vehicles for our troops. Sending them out in power armour increases our scavengers chance of survival, but will otherwise not impact the time or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard vehicles mission."

  scavenge_vehicles_motor: "Scavenge for Vehicles using Vehicles"
  scavenge_vehicles_motor_desc: "Send out our scavengers in our latest motor equipment - motorbikes, cars or trucks. Sending them this way will decrease the time the mission takes, but will otherwise not impact on their mortality rate or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard vehicles mission."

  scavenge_vehicles_fly: "Scavenge for Vehicles using Vertibirds"
  scavenge_vehicles_fly_desc: "Send out our scavengers in Vertibirds to find vehicles for our troops. Sending them this way will significantly decrease the time the mission takes, but will otherwise not impact on their mortality rate or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard vehicles mission."

  scavenge_owt: "Scavenge for Old World Tech"
  scavenge_owt_desc: "Old World Tech is the greatest treasure the wasteland has to offer. With it, we can build weapons faster, fight harder, research new tech quicker, build higher and live longer. We must venture out into the wasteland and find the technology for ourselves, bringing it back to our cities where it can benefit us.\n\nUnlike other scavenging decisions, our scavenging efficiency does not have any impact on these decisions."

  scavenge_owt_pa: "Scavenge for Old World Tech using Power Armour"
  scavenge_owt_pa_desc: "Send out our scavengers suited up in power armour to find Old World Tech for our troops. Sending them out in power armour increases our scavengers chance of survival, but will otherwise not impact the time or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard Old World Tech mission."

  scavenge_owt_motor: "Scavenge for Old World Tech using Vehicles"
  scavenge_owt_motor_desc: "Send out our scavengers in our latest motor equipment - motorbikes, cars or trucks. Sending them this way will decrease the time the mission takes, but will otherwise not impact on their mortality rate or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard Old World Tech mission."

  scavenge_owt_fly: "Scavenge for Old World Tech using Vertibirds"
  scavenge_owt_fly_desc: "Send out our scavengers in Vertibirds to find Old World Tech for our troops. Sending them this way will significantly decrease the time the mission takes, but will otherwise not impact on their mortality rate or efficiency of their mission from that of the standard Old World Tech mission."

  roll_out_tech: "Roll Out Technology to Scavengers"
  roll_out_tech_desc: "We have made new breakthroughs in science and equipment that will be beneficial both to our troops and our scavengers. Let us roll out these new advances to them!"

  scavenge_options: "Scavenging Options"
  scavenge_options_desc: "The scavenging menu can get cluttered - use this decision and the event it fires to help combat this."
 # Events #
  scavenge.1.t: "A Lost Contact"
  scavenge.1.d: "Today we have had no contact from our scavenging party - a relatively normal occurrence, except today is the tenth day in a row we have had no contact. We have their last reported location, so we could send a search party to the location to try and get them back - though this would take some organisation - or we could leave them to their fate."
  scavenge.1.a: "Send out a search party"
  scavenge.1.b: "They are not worth the effort"
  scavenge.2.t: "Equipment Scavengers Return"
  scavenge.2.d: "Our scavengers have returned from their mission, and managed to retrieve a host of useful equipment and spare parts. Their findings will surely help out with equipping our men in the battlefield, ensuring our victory if and when it comes down to war.\n\nNow our men need some time to recover and plan for a new scavenging mission for equipment by this means - whilst they do this, we can still send them out for something different, or by different means."
  scavenge.2.a: "We Welcome them Back"
  scavenge.3.t: "Robot Scavengers Return"
  scavenge.3.d: "Our scavengers have returned from their mission, and managed to retrieve a host of robot parts and the occasional whole robot. Our technicians will set right to work making the parts into robots ready to be deployed on the field of battle - saving countless lives as they bear the brunt of any attack.\n\nNow our men need some time to recover and plan for a new scavenging mission for robots by this means - whilst they do this, we can still send them out for something different, or by different means."
  scavenge.4.t: "Vehicle Scavengers Return"
  scavenge.4.d: "Our scavengers have returned from their mission, and managed to retrieve a host of vehicles and their parts. Our mechanics are hard at work putting the parts and whole vehicles to good use, allowing the motorisation and mechanisation of our army.\n\nNow our men need some time to recover and plan for a new scavenging mission for vehicles by this means - whilst they do this, we can still send them out for something different, or by different means."
  scavenge.5.t: "The Discovery of Old World Tech"
  scavenge.5.d: "Our scavengers have returned from their mission, and managed to retrieve some Old World technology! This new piece of tech will reap us many benefits, but we need to watch out, lest we break it through overexploitation!\n\nNow our men need some time to recover and plan for a new scavenging mission for Old World Tech by this means - whilst they do this, we can still send them out for something different, or by different means."
  scavenge.6.t: "Scavenging Decisions Options"
  scavenge.6.d: "From this window you can disable and re-enable each of the four subcategories of scavenging missions - normal missions, power armour missions, vehicle missions and vertibird missions. If you accidentally hide the wrong subcategory or wish to view a previously hidden subcategory again, just fire this event through the decision again and select the show option. The aim of this is to reduce clutter in the decisions window."
  scavenge.6.a: "Hide Standard Missions"
  scavenge.6.b: "Show Standard Missions"
  scavenge.6.c: "Hide Power Armour Missions"
  scavenge.6.e: "Show Power Armour Missions"
  scavenge.6.f: "Hide Vehicle Missions"
  scavenge.6.g: "Show Vehicle Missions"
  scavenge.6.h: "Hide Vertibird Missions"
  scavenge.6.i: "Show Vertibird Missions"
