  prioritise_living_standards: "Prioritise Living Standards"
  prioritise_living_standards_desc: "It is by no means a stretch to say our people live in good conditions. They do not. The people are in need of some care and attention from us, so better now than later! The changes will be slow, but we'll get to a more stable society in time."
  research_consumer_tech: "Prioritise Consumer Technology"
  research_consumer_tech_desc: "Our R&D department is of the utmost importance to our nation. It develops new armour and weapons, upgrades old versions and modifiers what we find in the waste.

  basic_hygiene_education: "Basic Hygiene Education"
  basic_hygiene_education_desc: "The people have forgotten the hygiene we once had in the old world. As a result, disease spreads like wildfire and people live in little better than pigsties. We should divert some of our precious time to educating them with better hygiene practices!"

  purge_elites_desc: "The leading body has grown since we took power, expanding to be able to control the country effectively. However, some of the members of our elite are not loyal to our cause, but are careerists instead. They use our cause to further their own interests - it is time for us to remove them from amongst us. The people will undoubtedly be happy at this change."
  war_propaganda: "War Propaganda"
  war_propaganda_desc: "War is nears the cities and villages of our peoples. It is time to ready them for war in their homes - let us drum up a favour of war support, so that they may be ready to tackle any cause in the name of our country and the war effort."
  militarized_society: "Militarise Society"

  mobilise_people: "Mobilise the People"
  mobilise_people_desc: "We need to call on more of the populace to join the army, and we need them now. We must launch on a recruitment drive to get them into the trained reserves much faster."
  patriotic_boost: "Seize on Patriotism"

  extend_mil_production: "Emergency Military Production"
  extend_mil_production_desc: "In this time of war, we can draft in extra consumer goods factories to temporarily boost the war effort. The people will grumble, but the guns are what is needed now, not their undying support."

  territory_disputes: "Territorial Disputes"
  territory_disputes_desc: "When a nation's long term territorial conquest plans are disrupted by another, they can demand these territories be returned to them. Failure to return these territories in a timely manner is a rightful justification for war."
