enc_events_epilogue.2.t: "The Fate of Ghouls"
enc_events_epilogue.2.d: "The Ghouls were often treated as outsiders within New California, and the rest of America.  Some were treasured for their prewar skills, or pitied for their deformities.  Others were feared due to the possibility of going feral.  With the coming of the Enclave:"
enc_events_epilogue.2.d.integrate: "They were integrated into civil society once and for all.  Ghouls helped America grapple with its history, for better or worse."
enc_events_epilogue.2.d.segregate: "Their fate was grim. To protect the peoples of the Wasteland, it was decided to quarantine from the human population, and ultimately, to ensure no one had to risk the threat of feral ghouls."
enc_events_epilogue.2.a: "So It Goes"

enc_events_epilogue.3.t: "The Fate of Dornan"
enc_events_epilogue.3.d: "With America saved, Dornan resigned with honors and retired to the Strip, developing cocktails which used Nuka Cola as a mixer.  Dornan's bar, the Oil Rig, would become one of the hottest bars of New Vegas, although there were several HR complaints about his reaction if staff were caught out of uniform."
enc_events_epilogue.3.a: "Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for an Atomic Agave!"

enc_events_epilogue.4.t: "The Fate of Arcade Gannon"
enc_events_epilogue.4.d: "Gannon's mother fled from Navarro after the fall of the Oil Rig, but Gannon returned to the Enclave when Granite was elected.  He was one of many who put their hopes in the dream of a better world, and:"
enc_events_epilogue.4.d.gannon: "Found his faith justified.  Gannon would serve as Mayor of New Vegas for two terms, before retiring to practice medicine in Freeside. He would continue to complain that his partner made him carry too much when they went camping until his dying day."
enc_events_epilogue.4.d.nogannon: "Ended up fleeing the New America and its secret police.  Gannon would reach his end in the Capital Wasteland, aghast that the Enclave's tentacles had reached even there..."

enc_events_epilogue.5.t: "American Spring, or Nuclear Winter?"
enc_events_epilogue.5.d: "After the end of the Great War, freedom of speech vanished from most of America.  Would be despots crushed dissenters in the name of security, progress, or just because they could.  Under the Enclave,"
enc_events_epilogue.5.d.press: "The First Amendment was restored, and voices silent since the Great War spoke out.  Fueled by the dream of freedom and the economic boom that followed reuniting the Wastes, a new type of music arose, which the kids call New World Blues. It's about letting go of your first love, because you've met your next.  It's about letting go of the past, because you've got to enjoy the present.  And it's so poppy that everyone's parents hated it."
enc_events_epilogue.5.d.censorship: "Censorship reached new heights.  Hollywood was restored, turning out the stories the government wanted Americans to hear. The American Broadcasting Department played heroic stories of the war with China, promoted American past times like baseball, and painted those outside government control as terrorists, rebels, or fools.  One critic, shortly before her arrest, lamented that America was 'going full speed ahead... but facing backwards the whole time.'"
enc_events_epilogue.5.a: "EDE, Play Party in the USA"
#######################################################################################################################
enc_events_epilogue.6.t: "Was Democracy Non-negotiable?"
enc_events_epilogue.6.d: "House once said, 'If you want to see the fate of democracies, look out the windows. But House didn't address the fact that prewar America was not a democracy.  Granite's dream was to restore America at its best, and:"
enc_events_epilogue.6.d.freedom: "That meant the land of freedom.  Resigning after his second term, Granite stayed silent during debates over the Brotherhood War, the Chinese Conference, and the drive against Robot Santa Anna.  Those debates, bringing forth millions of voters across the Reunited States, were simply democracy inaction."
enc_events_epilogue.6.d.noelections: "Granite would let you noe one stop that dream.  But Granite did not trust anyone else to restore America. Who else could do it?  The NCR was a failed state, Hayes was a rat, House, a madnman in a cryotank, and Caesar?  Well, he'd been crucified. No, Granite would restore America to greatness.  And elections?  Well, the Great War had shown why those were a bad idea."
enc_events_epilogue.6.a: "So it goes"

enc_events_epilogue.7.t: "Separate or Equal?"
enc_events_epilogue.7.d: "The Enclave once believed that Wastelanders were mutants fit only for extermination, and even many 'Reformers' within the Enclave viewed the Wastelanders as, if human, second class citizens.  More than one Centrist saw the Wastelanders as humans, but inferior stock, who needed to be salvaged through genetic testing and other programs save the American people.  Under Granite:"
enc_events_epilogue.7.d.integration: "America tried to live up to its founding ideals, that all men are created equal.  Wastelanders, Vault Dwellers, and Enclave purists all lived together, continuing the American experiment."
enc_events_epilogue.7.d.segregation: "The Enclave implemented statutes to ensure that the best and brightest could reproduce, while limiting the rights and privileges of the 'genetically damaged.'  To save their children, Wastelanders desparately tried to claim Vault ancestry, or cram for standardized testing to show they were 'American citizens.' A lively trade in vault suits broke out, out of a foolish belief that this could guarantee citizenship. Tough, but how else do you save America?"
