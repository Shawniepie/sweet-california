  Bulleteater_DESC: "While born in Dogcity,  Bulleteater never looked up to the dogs within it. Even though everyone praised these mongrels as spirit animals, Bulleateater chased something else, the peak of armored infantry technology, also known as power armor. Two years ago, these ancient suits of armor drew him and his crew up northeast to New Sterling, to look for the rumored vault. The secret vault is said to store ancient tech, being power armor among this tech. Through his stubbornness and tyrannical disposition, Bulleateater continues the search to this day under the flag of the Iron Alliance."
  Stinger_DESC: "Similarly to Bulleateater, Stinger was never really a big fan of the beliefs of his peers. Stinger preferred to live in the moment, tearing through the roads with his boys, just like the bikers did in the Old World. One year after Bulleteater’s expedition, Stinger also decided to leave the Dog City. With an aggressive yet optimistic outlook, he managed to persuade many citizens of Dog City to join him in search of a free-wheeling lifestyle, forming Scorpion's Bite."
  final_Bulleteater_DESC: "Bulleteater always chased after power armor, and for the longest time, the peak of armored infantry technology was his ultimate goal. However, after uncovering New Sterling's Secret Vault, Bulleteater understood that while his goal was valuable, so was the family that he had left behind. The family that now needs to unite. As the chosen leader of this family, Bulleteater will now lead The Pack to greatness."
  final_Stinger_DESC: "Stinger always cherished his hogs, and  for the longest time, the open road was all he needed. However, after forming the Scorpion's Bite, Stinger understood that while the road was important to him, so was his family. The family that now needs to unite. As the chosen leader of this family, Stinger will now lead The Pack to greatness."
  final_OLDDOG_DESC: "Initially, Old Dog's brothers exiled him and his ghoulish family from the Hangdogs, forced him to create a separate band of raiders, the Withered Dogs. Soon after, Caesar's Legion invaded Dog City, which Old Dog still considered his home. Even though the Hangdogs exiled Old Dog, he was chosen to spearhead The Pack. Through his strategic wisdom, Old Dog will now lead his family, The Pack, to greatness."
  final_TEETH_DESC: "Bares-His-Teeth always prioritized his beliefs, the dogma that surrounded the mongrels of Dog City. After Caesar's Legion 's conquest of the Hangdogs, where he watched hundreds of mongrels brutally murdered by legates, Bares-His-Teeth understood that belief alone could not save his people. It's time to reunite the family. Bares-His-Teeth has been chosen to lead The Pack, and this time, with his newly found wisdom, Bares-His-Teeth will lead his family to greatness."
  Mesmer_DESC: "After obtaining Polybius, Mesmer finally achieved his goal, Mesmer can finally quench his deepest desires. Dealing with these unpredictable, hectic, dynamic raiders almost drove him mad. It finally paid off. Now not only he can control the robots made up of wires and circuits, but he can also control the biological robots. There is only one thing left,  extend Polybius's range. It is the time to strive towards total control, ultimate cohesion, salvation."
