  ces_death_in_the_canyons_desc: "The earliest years of the Legion were also some of the most brutal. In his conquest of the Canyons, Caesar brutally slaughtered three of the local tribes, each act just as cruel: but one act gained particular infamy in the wastes..."

  ces_the_malpais_legate: "The Malpais Legate"
  ces_the_malpais_legate_desc: "Joshua Graham, the Malpais Legate, was the co-founder of the Legion, and Caesar's greatest servant. A shrewd, cunning general - an early act cemented his legend across the Legion, and formed the basis of his military prowess."

  ces_caesar_son_of_mars_desc: "Caesar's will is law. He is a god amongst men, the son of the god of war, Mars. All in his legion live to serve him, as a blade serves his master. He is the teacher and master of the tribes under him - and in his conquest, taught them many lessons."

  ces_caesar_the_godslayer: "Caesar the Godslayer"
  ces_caesar_the_godslayer_desc: "Caesar will teach the Twin Mothers their final lesson. Their goddess is nothing more than an illusion - and can be slain. With their tribe broken and enslaved, they will be chained to Caesar's will - and used as healers for the Legion."

  ces_the_brotherhood_of_steel: "The Brotherhood of Steel"
  ces_the_brotherhood_of_steel_desc: "The Brotherhood of Steel are a backwards, insane tribe. They're the worst of humanity, hoarders - scavengers dressed in trappings of chivalry. They offer no future; they are a dead end."

  ces_the_last_knight: "The Last Knight"
  ces_the_last_knight_desc: "One member of the Brotherhood in particular resisted us for a long time, until we managed to capture and commit him to the gladiator arena. Though we had hoped he would meet his death in the arena, he has fought valiantly against everything we throw at him."

  ces_deconstructing_perfection: "Deconstructing Perfection"
  ces_deconstructing_perfection_desc: "With all the salvaged power armour parts we have gained from defeating the Mojave Brotherhood, we can potentially construct our own power armour with greater ease, though the use of servos is still a mystery to us."

 # Tribal sub-tree
  ces_new_judea: "New Judea"
  ces_new_judea_desc: "The Rome of old once conquered the province of Judea - then Israel, where Christianity was born. The Mormons, building a New Canaan in Utah, seem to be inviting a New Judea upon themselves."

  ces_the_white_leg_petition: "The White Legs Petition"
  ces_the_white_leg_petition_desc: "The White Legs, a nearby tribe, have repeatedly petitioned to join the Legion. As we now have a use for them, we should allow them to join in future, so long as they attack the New Canaanites for us."

  ces_white_legs_refuse: "Calling upon the Nomads"
  ces_white_legs_refuse_desc: "The White Legs have failed us, refusing to attack the Canaanites. Such insolence will not go unpunished. Another tribe in Utah, the nomadic 80s, can be used as a tool, to remove the Canaanites and later, the White Legs."

  ces_crossing_the_rubicon: "Crossing The Rubicon"
  ces_crossing_the_rubicon_desc: "Caesar's ancient namesake once crossed a river named the Rubicon, an unprecedented move that pitted him against Rome so that he could usurp it as Emperor. Similarly, our Legion crossing the Colorado River signifies total war."

  ces_war_for_hoover_dam: "War For Hoover Dam"
  ces_war_for_hoover_dam_desc: "The Dam is our only way into Nevada, into the Mojave - where our Rome lies, New Vegas. The Dam is also a spectacular prize, but all of this has been claimed by the Bear. We must go to war with the NCR to claim the Dam back."

  ces_the_burned_man: "The Burned Man"

  ces_lick_the_bulls_wounds_desc: "The war for Hoover Dam left us wounded - with many lost in the attempt for the Dam. More legionaries must be trained to make up for the fallen, as we regather our strength."

  ces_fortify_the_dam: "Fortify The Dam"
  ces_fortify_the_dam_desc: "Hoover Dam is naturally a heavily fortified location - but as such an important strategic location, we can afford to be over-cautious. Increasing the legionary garrison there, and constructing fortified towers - will make it harder to besiege."

  ces_fortification_hill: "The Fort"
  ces_fortification_hill_desc: "Fortification Hill, just before the Dam, is a prime location to begin the rebuilding of forces to retake the Dam. We should construct a camp there, to train new legionaries and command from."

  ces_the_rubicon_is_crossed: "The Rubicon Is Crossed"
  ces_the_rubicon_is_crossed_desc: "With the Dam taken, and Colorado crossed, Caesar has fulfilled his crossing of the Rubicon. This is a symbol of Caesar's will to total war in the West. All beyond the Colorado will be his in time."

 # Mexico sub-tree
  ces_mexico_expansion: "Mexican Expansion"
  ces_mexico_expansion_desc: "South of Caesar's territory is the land of Mexico. It is a prime point of expansion, with many weak tribes and nations. Should the Legion's army find themselves in Mexico, their conquest would be easy."

  ces_baudelio_ranchers: "The Baudelio Ranchers"

  ces_the_lights_of_vegas_desc: "The Lights of Vegas shine from end to end of the Mojave wastes. A beacon to some, a target for us. To build our Nova Roma, we must first wrest control of New Vegas from Mr House and the Families."

  ces_the_eternal_city: "The Eternal City"
  ces_the_eternal_city_desc: "Just as the city of ancient Rome was once described as 'the Eternal City' - so shall New Vegas. The Strip never closes, and the caps never stop flowing."

  ces_caesers_palace: "Caesar's Palace"
  ces_caesers_palace_desc: "Deep in the ruined parts of the Strip, a casino called 'Caesar's Palace' has been unearthed. It seems it was almost destiny for the Legion to take the Strip, and discover this palace. Caesar has taken the casino as his seat of power, and begun reconstruction efforts."

  ces_open_the_lucky_38: "Break The Bank"
  ces_open_the_lucky_38_desc: "The Lucky 38 stands tall, watching over the Strip. Inside, Mr House must have housed many treasures and, as it has not been opened since before the war, much pre-war technology."

  ces_expand_the_via_militaris: "Expand The Via Militaris"
  ces_expand_the_via_militaris_desc: "With our conquests in the Mojave won, and our frontier pushed to Vegas - the Via Militaris should be expanded into the Strip, for easier access for our soldiers."

  ces_mccarran_airstrip: "McCarran Airstrip"
  ces_mccarran_airstrip_desc: "Outside Freeside is the McCarran Airstrip, seized from the NCR after Vegas was conquered. With some work put in, this could be the base of a Legionary Air Force."

  ces_scouring_the_strip: "Scourging The Strip"
  ces_scouring_the_strip_desc: "The Strip was once used by the NCR to improve morale by its soldiers. Such decadence and debauchery is uncharacteristic of a proper military force, so we will scourge the Strip, and use it to arm our soldiers."

  ces_nova_roma: "Nova Roma"

  ces_a_worthy_foe: "A Worthy Foe"
  ces_a_worthy_foe_desc: "For the first time, the Legion has encountered a foe perhaps more powerful than itself, and the first foe that Caesar is ideologically opposed to. The NCR is, indeed, a worthy foe for Caesar's fledgling Legion."

  ces_divide_et_impera_desc: "Divide Et Impera, or 'divide and conquer' - is the principle of dividing a larger power into smaller powers, in order to better conquer or rule over the parts. By attacking key areas of the NCR, we can weaken them enough to be more easily conquered."

  ces_camp_searchlight: "Camp Searchlight"
  ces_camp_searchlight_desc: "Vulpes Inculta has come to us with a plan. The NCR Camp in the town of Searchlight could easily be sabotaged by opening some irradiated barrels of nuclear waste inside the town, irradiating the town and the NCR soldiers within."

  ces_battle_of_nipton: "Battle Of Nipton"
  ces_battle_of_nipton_desc: "The town of Nipton, though only small, could prove an extremely important strategic point to launch assaults on the NCR in Mojave. By expending some manpower to take it, we can seize the town as a base across the Colorado."

  ces_spqr: "S.P.Q.R."
  ces_spqr_desc: "In the civil war that became of Caesar's death, Vulpes Inculta emerged victorious. This move will likely mean the Legion becoming less of a militarised force, but Vulpes Inculta has many strengths of his own."

  ces_lanius: "The Immortal Empire"

  ces_tame_dog_city_desc: "The Hangdogs fought us to the bitter end and even now the people who they protected resist our arrival, both economically and socially. Let us show these people their place, track down their skilled workers and remind them under whose banner they now live."

  ces_legion_salvagers_desc: "Dog City is a remarkable place, filled to the brim with relics untouched by fearful tribals, or protected by packs of savage hounds who have been and bred here for over a hundred years.

  ces_enslave_hangdogs: "Enslave Hangdogs"
  ces_enslave_hangdogs_desc: "Here and there, among the hills and in the deep places of Dog City, small groups of diehard Hangdogs dare to defy us. We must break the will of their men, we shall separate the mother from the child, and in the name of the Legion these dogs shall be taught to kneel."

  ces_the_capital_desc: "Flagstaff is the heart and soul of the Legion. It was the first city conquered by Caesar, and it is the place to which all trade in the Four States region flows. Let us grow its reputation, let it be a city to rival any in the NCR!"

  ces_flagstaff_fort: "Flagstaff Fortress"
  ces_flagstaff_fort_desc: "The Legion is a machine, it takes in weak things and spits out mighty things. Boys become men, men become soldiers, soldiers become heroes, heroes become legends. But before this can happen? Our Legionaries will require weapons."

  ces_slaves_to_flagstaff_desc: "From all across the Four States, and beyond, the come to us. Shackled and bound, broken in spirit and mind. We shall give them purpose again, they shall work for the greatest force in the wasteland, or they shall die trying to resist it."

  ces_settlers_in_phoenix: "Settlers in Phoenix"
  ces_settlers_in_phoenix_desc: "Water is a precious thing in the wasteland, and in Arizona, we have so little. Almost all of it flows to one place, through one series of rivers.

What better place for a Legion outpost than a den of wickedness?"

  ces_slaves_in_phoenix: "Slaves in Phoenix"
  ces_slaves_in_phoenix_desc: "All things are traded in Phoenix, among them slaves. Brought inland from slavers in both Baja, and further south in Mexico, these people do not speak our language, yet they work with the will of people who desire to one day return home.

  ces_two_sun_warcamp_desc: "The Legion does not have a permanent base within the City of Two Sun, to remind these people that they live under our thumb, so in response Caesar ordered the construction of a massive military camp less than a mile from the city.

  ces_enslave_tribals: "Enslave Tribals"
  ces_enslave_tribals_desc: "The people of Two Sun are relatively safe from Legionary conscription, yet the tribals who were under their protection are ours to claim now. The Tombwalkers, the Sun Hunters, and the Roadrunners shall be absorbed into the legion, and form the heart of a new cohort."

  ces_honestas_industria_prudentia: "Honestas, Industria, Prudentia"

  ces_fort_construction: "Fort Construction"
