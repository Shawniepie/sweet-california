  nf_moc.1.d: "All the earth is a grave and nothign escapes it, \nNothing is so perfect that it does not descend to its tome.\nRivers, rivulets,fountains, and waters flow,\nbut never return to their joyful beginnings. \nAs they hasten on the vast realms of the rain god, \nThey also fashion the sad urn of their burial."

  nc_moc.12.t: "Defeat in the Flower War"
  nf_moc.12.d: "Bad news from the front - the border clash is over, and our troops have been forced to retreat from the border. Moctezuma overran our border villages and settlements, destroying large swathes of land and infrastructure. Our troops have retreated to more defensible positions further back from the border, but we doubt the AI will engage in a prolonged campaign. Instead we shall have to wait for them to retreat, lick our wounds and attempt to rebuild. We shall be more ready for them next time."
