That's my dream. That's my nightmare. Crawling... slithering... along the edge of a straight... razor... and surviving. I am that snail. Crawling... slowly dying... Do you call me an assassin then? You? You have not seen what I have seen. You have not understood what I have understood.'....Then the broadcast goes silent, filling the soundwaves with a eery cacophony of eletric static... "
