  nf_warren.1.t: "The First Holotape"
  nf_warren.1.d: "\"Your name is Andrew Shaw, you were born on april 24th, 2043. You have a family, two proud sons who you promised to protect, a wife who you must see again. It's why you became a soldier, Andrew. To protect them. You were raised in Portland. That is your home. When you're ready, you have to go back. You have to face what happened, find your legacy. They were in a vault, Andrew. Your children might have grandchildren, or a some other legacy. Find them; find yourself. You can't forget this, Andrew; you have to remember what matters: what you must do.\""

  nf_warren.2.t: "The Second Holotape"
  nf_warren.2.d: "\"Monster, you're becoming a monster. Even now I can feel it in the back of my mind, the numbing sensation. It's growing so hard to focus. Even now they are emerging from the woodworks, the few who survived the fall of the Old World. Some drink the water, some bathe in it, desperate to become like you, to become powerful enough to survive. You must make something for them, something to protect them. A fortress, a city, an army? I don't know. Protect them, you are the first of our kind, you must lead.\""

  nf_warren.2.b: "I must build a city."
  nf_warren.2.c: "I must build an army."

  nf_warren.3.t: "The Third Holotape"
  nf_warren.3.d: "\"We weren't ready for them. They came in the night, post guards. They overwhelmed the perimeter, they killed your people. Not again, don't let this happen again. Find the strongest amongst your people. With guns and grit, one two step. Like the old days. Like the army. Teach them how to fight. Teach them how to protect the Warren.\""

  nf_warren.4.t: "The Fourth Holotape"
  nf_warren.4.d: "\"Your people are starving. You can not reproduce. You have little here. You must survive. You must take. Go and find what you need. Resources, Slaves, Warriors. Take what you need to survive, it's the way of the world now. Darwinism, do you remember that? Survival of the fittest, survival of the strongest. There are none stronger than you, remember that, believe in it, and you will survive. Your people will survive.\""

  nf_warren.5.t: "The Challengers"
  nf_warren.5.d: "The First has a tradition of accepting any and all challenges to his authority within the Troll Warren. He has never been bested, but often, his best commanders and allies come from those he has bested in single combat. In recent memories, those who came the closest were the fierce Bonesnarl who attempted to fight him head on. The nightkin Pittman, who attempted to overwhelm the First while his back was turned, and with the cover of his stealth boy. And Betty, a mutant from the far east, who almost overpowered him with her sheer strength."

  nf_warren.6.t: "New Mariposa"
  nf_warren.6.d: "Pittman tore apart the armour-clad \"normals\" guarding the entrance to Vault 6, once again proving that super mutants are the next step in human evolution, the true children of the apocalypse. Vault 6 was home to advanced technology and unthinkable experiments, all buried beneath hardened lava and ash: now it belongs to us. Rowdy mutants jeer at each-other as they tip over barrels of Forced Evolutionary Virus, filling the rusted halls with a sickly green glow. This time the Master's vision will be fulfilled. The age of super mutants has dawned!"
  nf_warren.6.a: "We will avenge the Master's death!"
