They shall become as we are, or they shall be cast aside!”"

  trl_greattribes: "The Great Tribes"
  trl_greattribes_desc: "Of all the northern tribes, there are none greater than the Bone Dancers, who stand atop the masses of unworthy.

Like all others, they must be defeated."

  trl_dancingbones: "Dancing on their Bones"
  trl_dancingbones_desc: "The Bone Dancers were infamous for their post battle feasts, during which they would pile high the bones of those they'd consumed into a vast, fleshy mass of gore. Their bravest warriors would dance atop these bones until growing too tired to move. To be the last man moving was a great honour among their people.

  trl_greatherd_desc: "There were few among the Bonedancers who weren't worthy of the gift, and even now as columns of their people are dragged to the pits, it has become clear to all that they shall become a great horde of mutants, one that will further our cause greatly in the years to come."

  trl_memories_of_ages: "Memories of Ages"
  trl_memories_of_ages_desc: "The memories of ages past still linger in the mind of the First, troubling his dreams and inspiring him in the depth of pitched battle.

  trl_weaponspast_desc: "Lead, powder, the thundering sound of death. These are the weapons of old, those that have determined the fate of uncountable lives throughout history.
