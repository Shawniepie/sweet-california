  electronic_engineering: "Ohm's Law"
  electronic_engineering_desc: "Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. It is quintessential for anything remotely related to electricity."
  electronic_engineering_1: "Resistor"
  electronic_engineering_1_desc: "A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat, may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators."
  electronic_engineering_2: "Vacuum Tubes"
  electronic_engineering_2_desc: "A vacuum tube, an electron tube, is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container. Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a heated cathode. This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. "
  electronic_engineering_3: "Simple Circuitry"
  electronic_engineering_3_desc: "An electronic circuit is composed of individual electronic components, such as resistors, vacuum tubes, capacitors, inductors and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow."
  electronic_engineering_4: "Complicated Circuitry"
  electronic_engineering_4_desc: "The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another."
  electronic_engineering_5: "Miniaturized Circuitry"
  electronic_engineering_5_desc: "Miniaturization is the trend to manufacture ever smaller mechanical, optical and electronic products and devices. With the ability to store ever more hardware power in less and less space have computers drastically reduced in scale."
  electronic_engineering_6: "Advanced Circuitry"
  electronic_engineering_6_desc: "The Pip-Boy 2000 displays information in bright green on its black 5\" x 3\" screen, can record sound and video footage for later playback, and uses a simple yet elegant form of sonar and satellite tracking where satellite coverage is available to map out areas where its user travels. Though input is slow, a user can also hand-enter and edit text messages on the Pip-Boy 2000. Also available in gold, white and blue."
  electronic_engineering_7: "ZAX Technology"
  electronic_engineering_7_desc: "Developed by Vault-Tec, Zax is a series of advanced supercomputers capable of learning, independent thought and creativity, with added error insertion to improve its variance in experience and learning capability. ZAX 1.0, the original prototype, went online in 2054. Initially a prototype of some of the systems designed to govern the Vaults, it was given to the federal government to help the Department of Energy collect resource data. Within a year, it was taken by the American military for plague and tactical research; one version of the machine, ZAX 1.2, was constructed for the defence contractor West Tek."
  encryption: "Secret Language"
  encryption_desc: "With orders frequently yelled accross the battlefield, it's very easy for the enemy to predict movements or distinguish orders. To counteract this effect, we will give a manual to every officer and troop, covering common orders that can be swapped for other words and military terminology, meant to confuse and distract our opponents."
  encryption_1: "Encoded Signals"
  encryption_1_desc: "To secure our communication further, we will provide encoding signals on a bi-weekly basis. Changing our encryption so frequently requires efforts in flexible decryption training and manual manufacturing, but the added security is more than worth it."
  encryption_2: "Polyalphabetic Ciphers"
  encryption_2_desc: "By using random alphabetic ciphers, we can considerably improve our radio transmission security. With each letter of a transmission replaced by another one, each time chosen from multiple alphabetic cipher tables, this system provides significantly lessened chances of code cracking without access to the actual ciphers or decryption machines."
  encryption_3: "Pulse-Code Modulation"
  encryption_3_desc: "Rapidly switching transmission frequencies, coupled with distraction modules sending garbage intel on multiple channel spectrum, let our signal personel operate with little chance of enemy breakthrough. Radios able to decipher such swift frequency changes are also second to none, letting us manufacture the only model able to do so."
  encryption_4: "Digital Encryption"
  encryption_4_desc: "Random-algorithm encryption programs are the peak of what our researchers can provide us in term of encryption technology. With constant binary fluctuations of internal datas, any transmission intercepted by the enemy is as liable to be a garbled mess as to utterly fry their equipment from information overload."
  decryption: "Reference Manual"
  decryption_desc: "As we manage to capture more enemies, and gather more information about their command structure, we can provide a simple résumé of our findings. Common keywords used as orders, along with prefered tactics and strategy during battle, will let our officers and soldiers anticipate enemy manoeuvers."
  decryption_1: "Decode Signals"
  decryption_1_desc: "Advanced decryption is the key to manipulate the battlefield to our advantage and predict the movements of enemy troops. As such, rear-line hunting parties are armed with pistols and explosives, tasked with raiding enemy command structures and communication outpost for any intel available or even to capture enemy personel."
  decryption_2: "Frequency Analysis"
  decryption_2_desc: "As more unknown cyphers are encountered, we cannot hope to crack them on guessing alone. Bringing in specialists will yield impressive result, along with using a frequency swiper. Garbled mess can also frequently be cracked by applying common language keywords, such as the Etaoin shrdlu method."
  decryption_3: "Side-Channel Attack"
  decryption_3_desc: "Main channels are often difficult to crack, but by bypassing the message itself and cracking the hardware we can totally avoid intel ciphers. Instead of looking at the message itself, we can instead look at it's transit time and decryption timing, which will let us work out exactly how much time every decription input takes to be processed, letting us gain access directly to the final message instead of having to do the cracking ourselves."
  decryption_4: "Digital Decryption"
  decryption_4_desc: "While random algorithm encryption is becoming more and more common, as is extremely difficult cyphers, our enemies have forgot one things. That decryption isn't everything in intel warfare. Broad-spectrum and otherwise multi-frequency jammers are set up around expected areas of information, making received messages incomplete or even missing entirely, forcing our enemies to switch to backup methods which are much easier to intercept and decipher."
  communication_engineering: "Combat Language"
  communication_engineering_desc: "To ensure proper communication, be it in the middle of a melee or a bombardment, our soldiers have taken to distinctive hand gestures with different meanings. Standardizing these techniques should improve intelligence transmission, and provide a base upon which to build our intel network."
  communication_engineering_1: "Smoke Signals"
  communication_engineering_1_desc: "Smoke signals used as rudimentary communication is a good way to project orders accross a battlefield. Of course, old camps with stone fire won't be enough. Trained signal personel will man a rear-line outpost, using a campfire with flamer fuel and colored smoke, will be required to have orders be seen accross the blasted battlefield."
  communication_engineering_2: "Primitive Radio"
  communication_engineering_2_desc: "The discovery of multiple so called "ham radio" magazine have provided very useful blueprints to our scientists to build primitive radios, able to supplement our existing system with a long-range alternative allowing better strategical communication."
  communication_engineering_3: "Radio"
  communication_engineering_3_desc: "Advances in radio manufacturing allow both increased range, miniaturization, decreased power draw and most importantly, the ability to install automatic encryption or decryption devices. It is a considerably important tool, and as such only the most dedicated soldiers can operate it."
  communication_engineering_4: "Long Range Radio"
  communication_engineering_4_desc: "An interconnected network of backpack military radio, combined with mobile antennas installed in rear-line outposts, let our command staff become quickly aware of any developping situations, and able to send reinforcement rapidly to any hotspot."
  communication_engineering_5: "Digital data Links"
  communication_engineering_5_desc: "Centralized command networks and military outposts are now equipped with state of the art data uplink, connected to our soldier's helmet HUD, and allowing any of them to quickly access the situation even while under fire. Such technology is a trendemous progress in intel gathering equipment, which will also allow better communication between our laboratories."

  radio_detection: "Radio Detection"
  radio_detection_desc: "The development of RADAR, Radio Detection and Ranging, allows using radio waves to detect physical objects. Research is highly secretive, considering the impact these inventions could have on locating units."
  decimetric_radar: "Decimetric Radar"
  decimetric_radar_desc: "Many units rely on the element of surprise for their efficiency. Development of decimetric radar allows us to deprive them of this advantage."
  improved_decimetric_radar: "Improved Decimetric Radar"
  improved_decimetric_radar_desc: "The use of radar has already proven crucial, but our decimetric radar sets are too few to ensure good coverage. Fitting more units with radar will allow us to maximize our technological edge."
  centimetric_radar: "Centimetric Radar"
  centimetric_radar_desc: "New radar operating in the microwave bands enable us to detect objects too small for previous radars to pick up."
  improved_centimetric_radar: "Improved Centimetric Radar"
  improved_centimetric_radar_desc: "Introducing cutting-edge radar techniques like monopulse radars in key operations will allow for extreme tracking accuracy."
  advanced_centimetric_radar: "Advanced Centimetric Radar"
  advanced_centimetric_radar_desc: "Despite our advanced radars, there are still ways for the enemy to avoid detection. New developments like the Pulse-Doppler radar allows us to eliminate many of these limitations in our equipment."
