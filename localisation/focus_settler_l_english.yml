It is time to take back what is rightfully ours, to avenge our people and every single loss we ever suffered. We will give power to the factory managers, the business magnates, and the rich. They will give us weapons, and they will give us blood."

  settler_empower: "Empower the Mayor"
  settler_empower_desc: "Political strife cannot be afforded in those dark times. Our mayor is a knowledgable man, wise as well as strong. He led us to this point, and he can lead us much further. It is time to give even more power to his position, and assure his power in the coming crisis."

  settler_oligarch: "Oligarchical Power"
  settler_oligarch_desc: "Empowering the oligarchy further, and setting up dedicated infrastructure for them to coordinate and dominate the economy, will give us even further boost to our arms industries.

It will not be long until they are made the rulers of our country, and there is little wrong with that."

  settler_focus_monopoly: "Monopoly"
  settler_focus_monopoly_desc: "Surprisingly, a few business magnate actually fled our state after seeing the display of militarism and violence in the aftermath of revengist sentiments.

  settler_tato: "Tato Farmers"
  settler_tato_desc: "Organizing a deeper farming system relying on simple backyard gardens will allow every family to feed themselves to a small extent, lessening the strain on our agricultural system and letting our population grow with our food supply."

  settler_brahmin: "Brahmin Herders"
  settler_brahmin_desc: "Brahmin breeding and herding, learned from traders using them in their commercial convoy, will give our population a sizeable increase in food stock from both the milk, as well as the meat, which is enough to feed an entire small villages for a week. Using every part of the brahmin in recipes and practical applications will increase it even further."

  settler_future: "Plan for the Future"
