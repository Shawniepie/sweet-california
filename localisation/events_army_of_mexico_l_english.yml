  nf_arm.1.t:0 "Lessons of the Father"
  nf_arm.1.d:0 "Santa Anna was the firstborn creation of the mighty AI Tlaloc, known to be the single most powerful AI in all of the wasteland. Throughout his developmental states, Tlaloc imparted innumerable lessons onto Anna, working to shape him into the entity that he is today. Despite being a recreation of the original Caudillo, it is these lessons that form the very bedrock of who the Generalissimo is."

  nf_arm.2.t:0 "The Ciudad Victoria Ultimatum"
  nf_arm.2.d:0 "One of Santa Anna's first tasks was to clear Ciudad Victoria of bandits and raiders.  When he reached the city, his robot army threatened them with surrender. The General's robots broadcast a simple instruction to those who surrendered."
  nf_arm.2.a:0 "Join the army!"
  nf_arm.2.b:0 "Join the reconstruction authority."
 #################################
  nf_arm.3.t:0 "The Battle for Tampico"
  nf_arm.3.d:0 "Tampico was the next city to be liberated for Tlaloc and Mexico. Home to a band of rogues who called themselves revolutionaries, Santa Anna drove them out through skillful use of his army."
  nf_arm.3.a:0 "The conscripts fought heroically..."
  nf_arm.3.b:0 "But steel will stand when bones will break."
 #################################
  nf_arm.4.t:0 "The Destruction of Tamaulipas"
  nf_arm.4.d:0 "Tamaulipas, when Santa Anna approached it, was occupied by a detachment of the Texan Brotherhood. Once Santa Anna realized they were successors to the US army that invaded Texas so many times, it did not go well."
  nf_arm.4.a:0 "Santa Anna learned much from the prisoners."
  nf_arm.4.b:0 "And their supplies were most useful to the Ejercito de Mexico."
 #################################
  nf_arm.5.t:0 "Mandatory Service Revival"
  nf_arm.5.d:0 "Santa Anna has the singular goal of making sure that his small section of Mexico is going to be capable of sustaining his armies and military aspirations in the long run. For this purpose alone, a great deal of funding and political pressure is being poured into an initiative to kickstart the anemic economy."
  nf_arm.5.a:0 "Mandatory Military Employment"
  nf_arm.5.b:0 "Mandatory Civilian Employment"
  nf_arm.5.c:0 "Divided Mandatory Employment"
 #################################
  nf_arm.6.t:0 "Santa Anna's Equation"
  nf_arm.6.d:0 "Santa Anna has spent the better part of the last two years trying to weigh the tactical disadvantages of human variance against the potential benefit of integrating them into his armed forces on a larger scale. The core of his dilemma comes from the mathematical nature of his mind, which focuses heavily on the innate militant superiority of his fighting machines, which dominate human forces in almost every encounter. However, Anna also acknowledges that the intellectual flexibility of human forces, and the sheer quantity of humans he could bring to bear against his foes, could present a variable advantage that he can never truly quantify. His choice in the matter will determine the composition of El Ejercito de Mexico for decades to come."
  nf_arm.6.a:0 "Mechanical superiority outweighs human flexibility."
  nf_arm.6.b:0 "Human flexibility outweighs mechanical superiority."
 #################################
  nf_arm.7.t:0 "Not All Heroes Wear Capes"
  nf_arm.7.d:0 "For all his disagreements with Tlaloc's management of Mexico, Santa Anna views Tlaloc as a protector for the country. He has taken his illness poorly."
  nf_arm.7.a:0 "What will Mexico do without him?"
 #################################
  nf_arm.8.t:0 "Father of Mine"
  nf_arm.8.d:0 "No. Tlaloc cannot die. Santa Anna will not let his motherland suffer, and he won't let his father suffer either. Santa Anna may have quarreled with Tlaloc. Tlaloc may have, at times, felt his son was naive and a little too wild. But Tlaloc and Santa Anna have been each other's rock for over a century. How could he die?"
  nf_arm.8.a:0 "Take me back to the day, when I was still your golden boy."
  ################################
  nf_arm.9.t:0 "Wrathful Thoughts"
  nf_arm.9.d:0 "They are doing this to him. His \"sons\". I will annihilate them. My army will burn Moctezuma's empire to the ground, salt his fields and slaughter his mighty army, destroy Maximilian's dream before his very eyes and spit on the remains, and gut every single one of Zapata's beloved citizen like pigs, make sure they squeal and cry out for their \"savior\". When it is done, i will destroy every single evidence of their pathetic existence. They shall all burn, burn in hell for what they have done to father."
  nf_arm.9.a:0 "Gather my forces! Let none stand before my might!"
  #################################
  nf_arm.10.t:0 "Sacrifice"
  nf_arm.10.d:0 "What can i do to save him? There must be a way, any way, to get him to live. How can i revert this awful process? I will scour the entirety of my territory, surely there must be pre-war computers lying around that would do too?  Maybe i could even give him my own processing power? I must save him! Whatever the cost!"
  nf_arm.10.a:0 "Scour the entirety of the wasteland! Damn the cost, find those computers!"
  #################################
  nf_arm.11.t:0 "Despair"
  nf_arm.11.d:0 "I did this. This is all my fault. I stole what was rightfully his, used my father for my own desires. What have i done? Sweet Jesus what have i done? Become a simple thief? Worse, a murderer? I don't think i can continue. Continue? To have done the things i have done in the name of my petty goals? It was madness. Utter madness. Please Father... forgive me."
  nf_arm.11.a:0 "Father, please don't leave me..."
  #################################
  nf_arm.12.t:0 "He Walked on Water"
  nf_arm.12.d:0 "Tlaloc was not, Santa Anna knew, human. He did not feel shame or pride, or despair, the way Santa Anna did. But did not that make him a better person? He never acted out of anger. He never killed a prisoner out of irritation. He was always cool, calculating, and calm. \n\nWhy then, did Tlaloc send a message to Santa Anna that just said \"Be better than me?\""
  nf_arm.12.a:0 "I'm gonna be like you Dad, I'm gonna be just like you."
  #################################
  nf_arm.13.t:0 "Negotiating With The Cartel"
  nf_arm.13.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of a robot army led by the ghost of a 19th century general, cartels plague much of the General's territory. Some part of Santa Anna yearns to crush them end their blight, but this wouldn't be the first time he'd accomodated powerful influences in La Patria."
  nf_arm.13.a:0 "We should promote Mexican small businesses."
  nf_arm.13.b:0 "Let me explain how you negotiate with securitrons."
 #################################
  nf_arm.14.t:0 "Negotiating With The Militias"
  nf_arm.14.d:0 "The time has come for us to decide if we will meet the demands of the militias at the negotiations table. They could bring much needed strength, or tear our army apart from the inside. Shall we meet their demands and integrate them? Or simply dismantle them at gunpoint? All the same, now is the time to decide their fate"
  nf_arm.14.a:0 "Negotiate With The Militias"
  nf_arm.14.b:0 "We Negotiate With No One"
 ################################
  nf_arm.15.t:0 "The President's General"
  nf_arm.15.d:0 "Santa Anna has offered to join us in our great crusade, pledging El Ejercito de Mexico to Los Estados Unidos. How shall we respond?"
  nf_arm.15.a:0 "Santa Anna is many things, but a patriot first."
  nf_arm.15.b:0 "Let's not trust the robotic trickster."
################################
  nf_arm.16.t:0 "Testing the Rebels"
  nf_arm.16.d:0 "Santa Anna's troops will prepare to test [Rio.GetName]'s defenses. Hope they know how to beat robots led by the General!"
  nf_arm.16.a:0 "Viva Mexico!"
 ################################
  nf_arm.17.t:0 "Another Win for the General"
  nf_arm.17.d:0 "Yet again, the humans of Gloria show they excel only at dying. If they just gave Santa Anna what he wanted, most of them would probably survive."
  nf_arm.17.a:0 "This hurts you more than it hurts me."
 ################################
  nf_arm.18.t:0 "Victory for Rio!"
  nf_arm.18.d:0 "Somehow, [RRG.GetLeader] has prevailed against Santa Anna's forces. How could Santa Anna possibly lose to rebels in northern Mexico? Again!"
  nf_arm.18.a:0 "Am I a joke to you?"
 ################################
  nf_arm.19.t:0 "Santa Anna Calls Off the Offensive"
  nf_arm.19.d:0 "Recognizing that the better part of vlaour is discretion, Santa Anna cancels the offensive.  He'll finish off [RRG.GetLeader] soon. Very, very soon."
  nf_arm.19.a:0 "Still sounds like you lost to me"
 ################################
  nf_arm.20.t:0 "[From.GetLeader] Drives Back El Generalissimo"
  nf_arm.20.d:0 "Whether Santa Anna's armies wield grapeshot or lasers, his, err, men will never be the match for a free people. The people of Gloria sleep soundly tonight, knowing that their countrymen will always fight for freedom."
  nf_arm.20.a:0 "Viva [From.GetName]!"
 ################################
  nf_arm.21.t:0 "Santa Anna Humiliates [From.GetLeader]"
  nf_arm.21.d:0 "It appears that the prewar robot army can, in fact, defeat a nation that's powered solely by hope. The people of Gloria now look into the night, afraid if Santa anna will strike next."
  nf_arm.21.a:0 "Dios Mio."
 ################################
  nf_arm.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Deescelates"
  nf_arm.22.d:0 "It looks like the people of Gloria can sleep soundly, nknowing peace has prevailed. For now."
  nf_arm.22.a:0 "Peace in our time?"
 ################################
  nf_arm.23.t:0 "The Keys to Armageddon"
  nf_arm.23.d:0 "As a securitron handed over the keys to Mora, music played softly from a robot. \"Did you know, Senor Presidente, that I helped draft the national anthem?\" \n\n\"Si, Si,\" said Mora. \"I heard you performed it for the first time!\" The Generalissimo beamed. That's why he knew he could trust Mora. He remembered stories even Santa Anna forgot."
  nf_arm.23.a:0 "Death to our enemies!"
 ################################
  nf_arm.24.t:0 "The Keys to Armageddon"
  nf_arm.24.d:0 "Rio had fallen. Rosado had been crushed in a dark lab, Guerra resorting to guerilla tactics (and the Generalissimo winced at the pun), and Mora a prisoner. Now, at last, Santa Anna could access the plunder of the station."
  nf_arm.24.a:0 "Bueno, Muy Bueno."
 #################################
  nf_arm.25.t:0 "The Fate of Petro Chico"
  nf_arm.25.d:0 "As [ITZ.GetLeader] stirs and prepares to march north, Santa Anna has been forced to create a buffer for Northern Mexico. Sadly the people of Petro Chico, if left to their own devices, will be a roadblock. If harnessed to Santa Anna's war machine, however, they can be a valuable resource!  \nSanta Anna could take Petro Chico alone, or he can propose one of his brothers join him in an alliance. After all, Moctezuma has his own reasons to oppose the Mayans."
  nf_arm.25.a:0 "We can handle the Tribals without our brother."
  nf_arm.25.b:0 "Not the last of the Mexica; the first of the Mexicans."
 #################################
  nf_arm.26.t:0 "Moctezuma's Next Flower War"
  nf_arm.26.d:0 "Our brother Santa Anna has asked us to join him in dividing Petro Chico, and uniting against the Mayans. This might risk a war with the Mayans, but Santa Anna offers us [775.GetName]. Control of that province brings us to the borders of Tenochtitlan, the sacred homeland the Aztlans call Mexico City."
  nf_arm.26.a:0 "Together we will bring a rich harvest to Southern Hummingbird."
  nf_arm.26.b:0 "Sorry brother, we have other plans."
 #################################
 #################################
  nf_arm.27.t:0 "[RRG.GetLeader] Rejected Us!"
  nf_arm.27.d:0 "Recting any hope for peace, Mora has gone to war with us. Ah well, this is not the first time we crushed a rebel on the Rio Grande..."
  nf_arm.27.a:0 "Seriously, did Mora not read a history book?"
