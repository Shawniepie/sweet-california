  irn_nf_str_1: "The Great Migration"
  irn_nf_str_1_desc: "Two years ago,  following the rumors of New Sterling's secret vault, the Iron Alliance left Hangdog's Dogcity in search of power armors. While the rest of the Hangdogs were preoccupied with their spirituality, the Iron Alliance looked for the legendary T-51b. However, Bulleteater and his crew took a heavy toll, as the sheer scope of the power armor search quickly got out of hand."
  irn_nf_str_2: "Longing For Home"
  irn_nf_str_2_desc: "Initially, Bulleteater's crew enjoyed a lack of religious nagging. However, due to the lack of spirituality, the unity among the raiders of Iron Alliance considerably deteriorated."
  irn_nf_str_3: "New Head Researcher"
  irn_nf_str_3_desc: "While following the rumor of New Sterling, the raiders encountered a particular stranger. The Iron Alliance found someone that might come in handy."
  irn_nf_str_4: "Hope"
  irn_nf_str_4_desc: "With the recent addition to the Iron Alliance, much of the raiders felt a sense of New Sterling Ambition."
  irn_nf_str_5: "Slaves to the West"
  irn_nf_str_5_desc: "As a result of the search for power armor, the raiders had little to no time to collect new slaves, the backbone of the raiders’ economy.  It's time to prepare, though, as soon we will grow some backbone."
  irn_nf_west_1: "Enslave the Withered Dogs"
  irn_nf_west_1_desc: "While Withered Dogs are like brothers to the Iron Alliance, ghouls are the best slaves in the wasteland in terms of utility. Their radiation resistance is quite useful in the nuclear wasteland. They are perfect for use in power plants, better than as our brothers anyways."
  irn_nf_west_2: "Fort Collins' Power Plant"
  irn_nf_west_2_desc: "Now that the boys have taken some Ghoul slaves, the Iron Alliance can build a nuclear power plant. However due to logistical concerns, the power plant would have to be built at Fort Collins. Either way, the power plant will provide massive amounts of energy for the Iron Alliance's workshops."
  irn_nf_west_3: "Yearning for Yampa"
  irn_nf_west_3_desc: "It is time to conquer Yampa, a tribal nation, the next best source of slaves. While they certainly have much brawn useful for manual labor, they do not have that much brain. It is easy to command them into doing once bidding. Just show off some tech and jet."
  irn_nf_west_4: "The River Gods"
  irn_nf_west_4_desc: "Now that the crew took over Yampa, it is time for Iron Alliance to use them. Since Yampa was primarily a river tribe, they were experts in traversing the rivers of the wasteland. With their experience, the boys could use Yampa’s naval talents for raiding, slavery, pillaging, and trade."
  irn_nf_west_5: "Fracturing the Foragers"
  irn_nf_west_5_desc: "The least useful slaves are settlers, weak-willed, scrawny, and hard to lead. Can the Iron Alliance find any use for these degenerates? In the words of a long-dead raider chief: “Any slave’s a good slave.”"
  irn_nf_west_6: "Scientists to Slaves"
  irn_nf_west_6_desc: "Raiding the Foragers turned out to be easier than expected. While the Twisted Mothers was losing against Caesar's Legion, most of the Twisted Mothers' scientists escaped to the Foragers, seeking asylum from the forces of the Bull. Now, however, the Foragers’ territory is ours, and so are the refugee scientists. Who knows, these scientists could end up being useful later on."
  irn_nf_west_7: "Painting in Red"
  irn_nf_west_7_desc: "It’s time to conquer another tribal nation. This time, we’re targeting the Painted Man. There’s some good slaves to be had from these primitives, and we’ll take the time to paint them in our own shade of red."
  irn_nf_west_8: "New Colors"
  irn_nf_west_8_desc: "Now that the Iron Alliance conquered the Painted Man, the raiders have sated their thirst for slaves, for now. The Iron Alliance also gained something else from the conquest of the Painted Men, adopting some aspects of the tribe’s culture. New Sterling is now a canvas of crude graffiti."
  irn_nf_ncn_1: "The Mormon Question"
  irn_nf_ncn_1_desc: "From the Western Old-World state of Utah, a Mormon mission has arrived on our turf. It’s time to decide what to do with these Canaanite bastards."
  irn_nf_ncn_2: "The Road to the West"
  irn_nf_ncn_2_desc: "Screw New Canaan. The Iron Alliance does not need to cooperate with these Mormons nuts. It’s time to push to the Canaanites by conquering yet another tribal nation. Subduing Uintah will greatly improve the Iron Alliance's strategic position against New Canaan."
  irn_nf_ncn_3: "Mormon Forgiveness"
  irn_nf_ncn_3_desc: "The Mormons proposed to absolve the Iron Alliance, to cleanse us of our raider sins. This will be costly, though, as the crew would need to give up the former Yampan territory of Wild Mountain. However, this would put the Iron Alliance on better terms with New Canaan, and could be the beginning of a strong alliance."
  irn_nf_ncn_4: "Shut the Door on the Mormons"
  irn_nf_ncn_4_desc: "With Uintah in our hands, it’s time to strike New Canaan itself. With our new borders and our newfound power armor, this war against New Canaan should be a cakewalk."
  irn_nf_ncn_5: "Baptism"
  irn_nf_ncn_5_desc: "It's time to be baptized by the Mormons, allowing the Iron Alliance to come closer to the New Canaanites. Besides, maybe this sacrament will help the raiders to persuade the slaves to do their damn jobs."
  irn_nf_ncn_6: "Mormon Slaves"
  irn_nf_ncn_6_desc: "Now that New Cannan is under Iron Alliance's control, it’s to capture slaves from the territory of our conquest. These new slaves are mostly settlers and tribals, but are religious enough that we can control them easily by controlling their leaders."
  irn_nf_ncn_7: "The Alliance in the East"
  irn_nf_ncn_7_desc: "Now that Iron Alliance and New Canaan are like brothers, the crew can finally join the Mormon Alliance. Now, we’re capable of standing up to the likes of the NCR, the Washington Brotherhood, and even Caesar's Legion itself."
  irn_nf_mil_1: "The Future of our Forces"
  irn_nf_mil_1_desc: "Considering the raider's plans to the west, the crew will need to spend some additional time in our military. It's time to put on a hat and take out the plans!"
  irn_nf_mil_2: "Muscle"
  irn_nf_mil_2_desc: "To achieve anything in the West, the raiders will need some time to develop military doctrines, as conquering anyone without proper preparation will undoubtedly result in defeat. The training will be difficult on our men, but will create some of the finest soldiers the Wasteland has seen."
  irn_nf_mil_3: "Bulleteater's Might"
  irn_nf_mil_3_desc: "It's time to solidify Bulleteater's military command, as his experience with slaves will aid in the Iron Alliance's future raids. Making him train our men personally would ensure that the raiders know who the boss is."
  irn_nf_mil_4: "Mesmer's Expertise"
  irn_nf_mil_4_desc: "Maybe it’s time for a different approach. Mesmer's expertise and technical knowledge is quite impressive, and could be put to good use in building our military, though we’d have to endure his numerous eccentricities if we want to get any useful help out of him."
  irn_nf_mil_5: "Crank That Hog"
  irn_nf_mil_5_desc: ""Crank that hog, brother, it’s time to tear up the road." shouted a raider as he discovered New Sterling's scrapyard, full of potential vehicles. Soon after the crew followed,  looking to scavenge their own scrap motorbikes and choppers."
  irn_nf_mil_6: "Metal Raiders"
  irn_nf_mil_6_desc: "Bulleteater’s fervor for obtaining power armor has only grown, especially now that the Iron Alliance has found New Sterling’s vault. Soon, Bulleteater will accomplish his life’s goal, and bring an entirely new form of warfare to the East."
  irn_nf_mil_7: "Mechanical People"
  irn_nf_mil_7_desc: "Using Mesmer's expertise, the Iron Alliance can scavenge New Sterling's scrapyard for robot parts."
  irn_nf_ind_1: "Sterling's Headquarters"
  irn_nf_ind_1_desc: "Now that Iron Alliance is finally settled in, it’s time to establish a new headquarters, next to  New Sterling's Vault. From this new base, our raiders will be able to pillage, enslave, and raid to their heart’s content."
  irn_nf_ind_2: "Armed Raiders"
  irn_nf_ind_2_desc: "Iron Alliance will slowly arm the crew, by establishing military workshops in New Sterling’s headquarters. Careful planning will ensure the future development and scientific advancement of the HQ."
  irn_nf_ind_3: "Loaded Raiders"
  irn_nf_ind_3_desc: "A raider is nothing without his gun, and we’re short on guns. As such, it is time to pump out as many military facilities as possible, enabling the Iron Alliance to assert greater control over its slaves, yielding much better productivity in the long run."
  irn_nf_ind_4: "Smart Raiders"
  irn_nf_ind_4_desc: "While descending to the first floor of the vault, one of the boys found some blueprints. Mesmer thinks that it would be good to look into those blueprints, as they might aid our research."
  irn_nf_ind_5: "Raider Managment"
  irn_nf_ind_5_desc: "While the headquarters is already in place, we’re massively disorganized. It is time to further develop New Sterling's HQ by providing it with proper management."
  irn_nf_ind_6: "New Sterling Ambition"
  irn_nf_ind_6_desc: "Now that the Iron Alliance is here and is already somewhat established, many of the raiders are feeling a sense of New Sterling Ambition. As New Sterling Ambition spreads through the Iron Alliance, more and more of our crew want to fight and make a name for themselves."
  irn_nf_ind_7: "Local Slaves"
  irn_nf_ind_7_desc: "When looking for the Secret Vault, Bulleteater's crew did not have much time to take slaves. Now that the Iron Alliance is settled in, its time to start slaving again, starting with the locals of New Sterling."
  irn_nf_ind_8: "Warriors of the Wasteland"
  irn_nf_ind_8_desc: "From our tribal slaves, we learned a great deal on how to adapt to our surroundings, and now understand how to survive in the harshest of Wasteland conditions."
  irn_nf_ind_10: "New Sterling's Aggression"
  irn_nf_ind_10_desc: "Now that New Sterling Ambition fills the raiders, the Iron Alliance is ready to strike. All it needs to do is to select its next victim, the next nation to be pillaged, raided, and enslaved."
  irn_nf_ind_11: "Every Child a Solider"
  irn_nf_ind_11_desc: "We have low manpower? Decrease the age of conscription! This will allow us to gain manpower without impacting the efficacy of our forces."
  irn_nf_ind_12: "Even Smarter Raiders"
  irn_nf_ind_12_desc: "On the second floor of the New Sterlings' Vault, the Iron Alliance found lots of technology. Among this technology was some junk that Mesmer had a particular interest in. Time will tell whether this junk will serve our purposes."
  irn_nf_ind_9: "Civilized Drug Use"
  irn_nf_ind_9_desc: "Lots of people would overdose on drugs under the rule of the Iron Alliance. Now, with better policies, the crew will create an environment of civilized and controlled drug use."
  irn_nf_ind_13: "Organized Raiders"
  irn_nf_ind_13_desc: "The Iron Alliance always operated as a unit, albeit, a somewhat disorganized one. with the raiders lacking efficiency and productivity. It is time to reorganize, and take full advantage of our new management."
  irn_nf_ind_14: "New Sterling's Armor"
  irn_nf_ind_14_desc: "Filled with New Sterling Ambition, the boys managed to find some T-45 power armor suits scattered around New Sterling. Although the scavenged T-45s aren't the strongest type of power armor, they will undoubtedly serve well in future combat."
  irn_nf_ind_15: "Bigger Guns"
  irn_nf_ind_15_desc: "Bigger guns, bigger boom, what’s more to say? Obtaining howitzers is the next logical step for us, and with such firepower, the crew will be able to topple empires, one deafening blast at a time."
  irn_nf_ind_16: "The Artist"
  irn_nf_ind_16_desc: "The Iron Alliance managed to capture Painted Man's leader, Quick Asp. Under our iron fist, he will be able to help our crew make better graffiti, and will work wonders for the morale of the men."
  irn_nf_ind_17: "New Sterling's Superiority"
  irn_nf_ind_17_desc: "New Sterling now hosts all sorts of technology, guns, and power armor. The Iron Alliance's crew is finally truly content, taking jet, scavenging, and raiding as much as they please. We’ve created a true raider’s paradise."
  irn_nf_vlt_1: "Secret Vault"
  irn_nf_vlt_1_desc: "New Sterling’s secret vault finally sits in front of us, but cracking this bad boy open is harder than expected. Nonetheless, with each attempt, we get closer to the loot inside. Soon we will get inside, and we can only wonder what treasure awaits us."
  irn_nf_vlt_2: "First Floor"
  irn_nf_vlt_2_desc: "Shortly after entering the vault, one of the boys found an elevator. While this is good, what's not so good is that the elevator itself doesn't work. It will take some time before the Iron Alliance will be able to descend deeper into the vault."
  irn_nf_vlt_3: "Second Floor"
  irn_nf_vlt_3_desc: "While the vault's first floor held valuable loot, there are still two floors left. Disappointed, Mesmer continues to work on accessing the second floor. It will soon be time to descend even deeper and hopefully find yet more technology for the Iron Alliance to use."
  irn_nf_pac_1: "Danger from the South"
  irn_nf_pac_1_desc: "The third floor of the Vault has been damaged from centuries of decay, and is about to collapse. We’ll need to raid it immediately if we want to save the technology inside. However, Caesar's Legion taking over the Hangdogs is too alarming to ignore, and Bulleteater needs to do something about it. The Iron Alliance needs to prepare for the worst."
  irn_nf_pac_2: "Brothers from the Rockies"
  irn_nf_pac_2_desc: "Alone, the Iron Alliance does not stand a chance against Caesar's Legion. However, with the help of our raiders-in-arms, the Withered Dogs in the west, and Scorpion's Bite in the south, we might be able to hold Colorado."
  irn_nf_pac_3: "Orgin Over Race"
  irn_nf_pac_3_desc: "Although the Withered Dogs is full of ghouls, they are still the Iron Alliance’s brothers, dating back to our time working together in Dog City. Just like in the old days, we will unite to mutually overcome any crisis, no matter our differences."
  irn_nf_pac_4: "Orgin Over Dogma"
  irn_nf_pac_4_desc: "While Iron Alliance does not share the same principles as the Hangdogs, we both have the same enemy in the south. The Iron Alliance will reach out to the remnants of the Hangdogs, to offer a helping hand in the fight against Caesar’s Legion."
  irn_nf_pac_5: "Origin Over Culture"
  irn_nf_pac_5_desc: "While both the Iron Alliance and Scorpion's Bite left Dog City at similar times, both left for different reasons. The Iron Alliance wanted to search for power armors, and Scorpion's Bite wanted to ride the roads on their hogs. Their leaders are also quite different, Bulleteater's tyrannical rule differing quite a bit from Stinger's anarchic approach. Either way, both are cut from the same cloth, and both need to work together in this difficult time."
  irn_nf_pac_6: "The Pack"
  irn_nf_pac_6_desc: "It is the time to discuss the future of the East and Central Colorado with the other raider leaders, our brothers from Dog City. Perhaps there is value in maintaining this alliance that has seen us grow so powerful."
  irn_nf_pac_7: "Who's the New Boss"
  irn_nf_pac_7_desc: "It is time to choose a new leader, a new boss who will lead The Pack to future greatness."
  irn_nf_pac_8: "The Rest as Administrators"
  irn_nf_pac_8_desc: "Having chosen our leader, it’s time to place the remaining raider leaders into appropriate positions as the advisors of The Pack, where they will aid the one and only leader with leading The Pack to greatness."
  irn_nf_pac_9: "Grabbing the Bull by the Horns"
  irn_nf_pac_9_desc: "Caesar's Legion is preoccupied with the New California Republic, in a war that threatens to consume both nations. This is the perfect opportunity to strike and take back Dog City, the place where this all started. It’s a gamble, but if we succeed, The Pack will finally reign supreme over the East."
  irn_nf_pac_10: "The Compromise"
  irn_nf_pac_10_desc: "Caesar's Legion is preoccupied in a difficult war against the New California Republic. In exchange for the Legion giving us our past lands, we could offer our military assistance against the NCR. Through this sacrifice, we will create a future where we no longer need to fight to survive."
  irn_nf_pac_11: "Second Thoughts"
  irn_nf_pac_11_desc: "Much of The Pack has had second thoughts about the war against Caesar’s Legion. It's time to explore all the options we have available to deal with the Legion."
  irn_nf_bos_1: "Third Floor"
  irn_nf_bos_1_desc: "The collapsing third floor of the New Sterling Vault won't loot itself, and besides, the Iron Alliance has time to strike against Caesar's Legion after raiding the third floor. Plus, on this floor we can probably find even more technology that can be used in the coming battle against the Legion."
  irn_nf_bos_2: "Asserting Dominance"
  irn_nf_bos_2_desc: "Even though the leadership of the Iron Alliance is under Mesmer's hypnotic grip, there is no time to rest. We must increase Mesmer's influence by asserting dominance over the raiders that make up the bulk of the Iron Alliance."
  irn_nf_bos_3: "Complete Control"
  irn_nf_bos_3_desc: "The time has come to assert complete control over the Iron Alliance. We will take command of the slaves and civilians of the Iron Alliance by using the Polybius device, so that Mesmer can have the entire nation under his trance."
  #irn_nf_bos_4: "Zombie Soliders"
  #irn_nf_bos_4_desc: "Sechet is set to become one of our greater cities. Expanding the factories within it is only natural."
  irn_nf_bos_5: "Contacting the Nearest Brotherhood"
  irn_nf_bos_5_desc: "While the Iron Alliance was aware of the existence of the Mojave Brotherhood in the West, the Iron Alliance was never that close to them, since the Alliance never used any of the ancient technology that the Brotherhood holds so dear. With the Polybius at our disposal, we can demonstrate that we’re a force to be reckoned with, and possibly strike a deal with these technocratic hermits."
  irn_nf_bos_6: "Patching Up the Zombies..."
  irn_nf_bos_6_desc: "It's time to decide on how to deal with the unfortunate condition of our soldiers."
  irn_nf_bos_7: "A Gift of Technology"
  irn_nf_bos_7_desc: "As the Iron Alliance wants to improve their relations with the people they contacted, it is time to send them a gift of the armored infantry technology that we found in the New Sterling Vault as a gesture of goodwill."
  irn_nf_bos_8: "Exchanging Slaves for Smarts"
  irn_nf_bos_8_desc: "Our soon-to-be allies need slaves, for which they’re offering to give us generals and advisors in return. Even though the loss of labor is unappealing, the advisors and generals will help in bringing our military up to modern standards."
  irn_nf_bos_9: "Finally Advanced"
  irn_nf_bos_9_desc: "A new message sent by the Mojave Brotherhood just appeared on Mesmer's command terminal. They want to discuss future cooperation between the Brotherhood and the Iron Alliance. Perhaps there is value in aligning ourselves with the hermits? "
  irn_nf_bos_10: "Contacting The Nearest Vault"
  irn_nf_bos_10_desc: "Contacting the Mojave Brotherhood would be a good idea, but Mesmer desires something else than power armor. In his earlier days, Mesmer heard of the existence of Vault City, a high-tech settlement in western Nevada. With the Polybius, Iron Alliance can likely strike an alliance with these tech-hungry isolationists, even if it means having to cross the Wasteland to get to them."
  irn_nf_bos_11: "Finally Sheltered"
  irn_nf_bos_11_desc: "A new message sent by Vault City just appeared on Mesmer's command terminal. They want to discuss future cooperation between Vault City and the Iron Alliance. Perhaps there is value in aligning ourselves with the technocrats?"
  irn_nf_bos_12: "...Through Hospitality"
  irn_nf_bos_12_desc: "We can send our least-affected men on an undercover mission to retrieve the Twin Mothers' scientists from The Foragers. If we provide them sanctuary from Caesar's persecution, they should be willing to fix up our boys. While a traditional raider solution, this is assuredly our safest option."
  irn_nf_bos_13: "...Through Waterboarding"
  irn_nf_bos_13_desc: "The Iron Alliance was always a raider nation, and, as such, it will deal with its problems with violence, the tried and tested tool of raiders across the Wasteland. If we pillage the Forager’s territory, our boys should be able to capture scientists from the Twin Mothers. Using “enhanced interrogation techniques”, we will be able to extract the information we need to fix up our boys."
