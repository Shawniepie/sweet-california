  border_conflict_won_defender.1.a: "We've shown them our strength!"

  border_conflict_lost_attacker.1.d: "Forces under the command of [their_country.GetLeader] have succeeded in pushing us out of the disputed area between [our_state.GetName] and [their_state.GetName]. Our forces have retreated in good order and are reorganising should we want to renew the battle in the future."

  border_conflict_canceled_attacker.1.d: "The fighting in the [our_state.GetName]-[their_state.GetName] Area has ground to a halt as both sides have proven unable to dislodge the other. Little territory has been gained by either side. Scouts report that the [their_country.GetAdjective] soldiers on the other side are digging in on defensive terrain. It would appear that they intend to keep the territory they have, but probably won't push against our lines."

During the night, more [their_country.GetAdjective] forces have poured into the area and set up defensive positions inside our territory.\n\nThis follows a series of minor skirmishes and border violations by forces under the command of [their_country.GetLeader] all along our shared border.\n\nThis time, however, it is clear that the [their_country.GetAdjective] forces are here to stay. We must send forces into the region as soon as possible to check their advance."

  border_conflict_escalate_to_war.1.a: "We must be ready to meet them!"
