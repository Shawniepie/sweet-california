  nf_khans.1.t: "The Stories We Tell"
  nf_khans.1.d: "Once, when the lands were still freshly scourged by nuclear fire, four tribes emerged from a large vault. One settled in what is now Shady Sands. The others—the Jackals, the Vipers, and the Great Khans—roamed the land, taking what they needed, going where they wanted, living free under the starlit skies.\n\nIn our history the Great Khans have been struck down repeatedly by their enemies. Every time, however, we have beaten the odds and risen from the ashes. With our wounds still fresh, we should never forget where we came from. Our spirit is strong and the Great Khans will rise again taking what is rightfully ours from the dogs that scour the wastes. We will overcome any hardships and obstacles in our way—even if it requires great sacrifice."
  nf_khans.1.a: "The old Khans live on in us!"
  nf_khans.1.b: "Arise a new Khanganate!"

  nf_khans.2.t: "What Happened in Vegas"
  nf_khans.2.d: "Mr. House and his New Vegas bootlickers reminded us with blood of an important lesson—that if you want something, you must take it by any means necessary. It is a lesson we will not be forgetting any time soon. Our spirit is strong and nobody can say the Great Khans do not learn from their past.\n\nIt is clear that our exodus from New Vegas has taught us an important lesson. To truly prosper one must be willing to fight for what is yours. We should learn our lesson and never again allow anyone to take what is ours—regardless personal sacrifice. No one will belittle the Khans again.\n\n"
  nf_khans.2.a: "And so we shall teach anyone who messes with us a lesson"
  nf_khans.2.b: "And so we shall defend what is ours"

  nf_khans.3.t: "The Bitter Springs Massacre"
  nf_khans.3.d: "Blood was spilt today and someone will pay.\n\nWhen the NCR came to the Mojave, we thought they would be easy pickings. We raided their caravans, their towns, their camps—they couldn't stop us. At least, that's what we thought. In massive numbers, they tracked us to Bitter Springs and surrounded us. When our children, our sick and our old fled through a nearby pass, the NCR gunned them down to the last. When we stood and fought, they crushed us with numbers we could not even dream of.\n\nThis will not go unpunished—we will have our pound of flesh from the NCR! First, however, we have to bide our time, gather our strength and rebuild our ranks.\n\nAs the old saying goes—'we must forgive our enemies, but not before they are hanged'."
  nf_khans.3.a: "Revenge will be oh so sweet"
  nf_khans.3.b: "Never again will our people be caught helpless"

  nf_khans.4.t: "Followers of the Apocalypse Arrive"
  nf_khans.4.d: "After the events at Bitter Springs we were lucky enough to be approached by a small group of technologically advanced people who presented themselves as 'Followers of the Apocalypse'. As a gesture of their goodwill, they presented us with gifts of technology and new ideas—which will undoubtably be of great use to us in our upcoming struggles."
  nf_khans.4.a: "We shall embrace their culture"

  nf_khans.5.t: "Fate of the Survivors"
  nf_khans.5.d: "Victory against the peoples of High Chapel is now assured, and the bodies of our enemies litter the streets of settlements and the fields of the farms.\n\nNow it is up to us to decide what is to become of the towns and settlements of what was High Chapel—as well as the survivors that we have found sheltered in them. Two plausible options present themselves—either exploiting sympathies within the population to raise warbands, or forcing the populace into slavery. What shall be done?"
  nf_khans.5.a: "Integrate them"
  nf_khans.5.b: "Take them as prisoners for the mines"

  nf_khans.6.t: "Envoy to the NCR"
  nf_khans.6.d: "The NCR is the land of plenty, and the land of promise. It is time to begin a period of rapprochement with the NCR, in an attempt to settle our past and place it firmly behind us. Whilst the atrocities at Bitter Springs can never be removed from our memory, we can at least hope for a better relationship with the NCR in the future—indeed, hopefully, this could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement with the NCR in the near future."
  nf_khans.6.a: "Only good can come of this."

  nf_khans.7.t: "Great Khans Send Request"
  nf_khans.7.d: "When we crushed the forces of the Great Khans at Bitter Springs, we thought we had defeated them once and for all. However, this seems far from the truth—instead, the Khans have been using their extensive area of influence beyond Bitter Springs—stretching into the Grand Canyon and beyond, towards New Cannan—to replenish their forces and begin their activities once more. Recently, however, the Khans came to us with an interesting proposal—a formal end to conflicts between our troops and theirs. The agreement goes even further than this—in exchange for our bureaucracy and technology beginning to be transferred to the Khans, they agree to use their forces to protect our settlements and convoys in the Mojave—and even to assist our forces in any clash against the Legion."
  nf_khans.7.a: "They will be useful allies"
  nf_khans.7.b: "This change of tact seems too suspicious..."
  
  nf_khans.30.t: "Great Khans Want A Truce"
  nf_khans.30.d: "The Great Khans—a tribe dominating the wastes to the north of the Colorado, and stretching into the Grand Canyon—has suffered at the hands of the NCR. Not long ago, NCR troopers butchered the population of Bitter Springs—the principal settlement of the Khans—following the Khan's continued raids of NCR facilities and convoys. The Khans were able to replenish their ranks quickly enough, drawing new 'warbands' from occupied populations across their area of influence, and now possess a burning desire to see the NCR dead. Further, their continued raiding of the NCR in the Mojave has given them a unique insight into the NCR's fighting styles. To put the cherry on top, an envoy from the Khans has recently approached us, requesting a neutrality pact. There seem no drawbacks, [Root.GetLeader], should we accept their offer we might be able to convince them to backstab the N.C.R."
  nf_khans.30.a: "Accept their proposal"
  nf_khans.30.b: "We just can't trust them"

  nf_khans.8.t: "Great Khans Wish to Join the Alliance"
  nf_khans.8.d: "Not so long ago the Khans sent to us an envoy to which we discussed terms for a beneficial and mutual relationship. We had come to the agreement that there would be an end to hostilities between our two nations—and further stipulated that the Khans would protect our settlements and convoys in exchange for some technological and bureaucratic guidance.\n\nNow, however, the Khans wish to develop our relationship even further—with a pact of mutual assistance. They pledge to assist our forces in any future conflicts, on the condition we will do the same. Should we accept their offer?"
  nf_khans.8.a: "Yes, we need the help"
  nf_khans.8.b: "They are best kept at an arms length."

  nf_khans.9.t: "Great Khans Wish to Join the Alliance"
  nf_khans.9.d: "The Great Khans—a tribe dominating the wastes to the north of the Colorado, and stretching into the Grand Canyon—has suffered at the hands of the NCR. Not long ago, NCR troopers butchered the population of Bitter Springs—the principal settlement of the Khans—following the Khan's continued raids of NCR facilities and convoys. The Khans were able to replenish their ranks quickly enough, drawing new 'warbands' from occupied populations across their area of influence, and now possess a burning desire to see the NCR dead. Further, their continued raiding of the NCR in the Mojave has given them a unique insight into the NCR's fighting styles. To put the cherry on top, an envoy from the Khans has recently approached us, requesting a full-scale mutual assistance pact. There seem no drawbacks, [Root.GetLeader], but should we accept them into our faction?"
  nf_khans.9.a: "Yes, they will be useful"
  nf_khans.9.b: "We just can't trust them"

  nf_khans.10.t: "Rumours of Vault 22"
  nf_khans.10.d: "Recently we have heard rumours being told by travelers and explorers of a place engulfed by wild vegetation; a place where the plants fight back and, indeed, kill on a whim. It is said that no one has ever returned once they have entered—though it is also said this place houses ancient technologies that could greatly help our tribe. An expedition will be tricky—nye, even suicidal, but must it be done for the good of the Khans?"
  nf_khans.10.a: "[Root.GetLeader] demands it"
  nf_khans.10.b: "We should not throw away good men"

  nf_khans.11.t: "Vault 22 Discovered"
  nf_khans.11.d: "As our search team entered the remains of the mysterious underground dwelling it became clear that there was little left in the way of technology to be found here. The floor was littered with glass from shattered terminals and a strange green glow saturated the air around our men as they explored the vast networks of hallways.\n\nAs they headed deeper into the vault the walkways began to creek. It was not long before they made their way to the heart of the vault—where they found themselves surrounded by flora with a thirst for blood. A large amount of the team didn't make it past the atrium. With distant screams echoing the dark passage ways within; the survivors decided to..."
  nf_khans.11.a: "Continue the exploration"
  nf_khans.11.b: "Return to the surface before they got lost in this labyrinth"

  nf_khans.12.t: "A Ghoul in the Vault"
  nf_khans.12.d: "After fighting their way through to the distant screams, our men saw a humanoid shape in the dark. It turns out that this shape was a female ghoul, Keely, and once an NCR researcher. She has been trapped in this twisted hell for over twenty years, but is willing to help us with research and technology if we bring her with us out of this hell hole."
  nf_khans.12.a: "Bring her with us"
  nf_khans.12.b: "She once served our foes—kill her!"

  nf_khans.13.t: "Contact Lost"
  nf_khans.13.d: "A full week has passed since our brave team of Khan warriors last made radio contact with us from a location that we do not know. As time passes, their chance of survival seem every more fleeting—and the reports they sent back before going dark of killer plants certainly don't help the case that they remain alive. It is time to give up on them."
  nf_khans.13.a: "They made a noble sacrifice"

  nf_khans.14.t: "Vault 22 Looted"
  nf_khans.14.d: "After arriving at Vault 22, our team was unable to locate anything of much use to us. It almost seemed as if someone had reached this vault before us!"
  nf_khans.14.a: "Well at least we have the scraps."

  nf_khans.15.t: "[CES.GetLeader] Accepts Our Request"
  nf_khans.15.d: "[CES.GetLeader] has accepted our envoy with grace and has allowed us to join [CES.GetFactionName]. Our common desire to see the NCR fall brings us closer than ever. It will not be long now until [CES.GetFactionName] begins their march on the NCR scum."
  nf_khans.15.a: "Excellent"

  nf_khans.16.t: "[CES.GetLeader] Rejects Our Request"
  nf_khans.16.d: "[CES.GetLeader] has rejected our envoys requests to join [CES.GetFactionName] and so we will stand alone, for now."
  nf_khans.16.a: "This is unfortunate"

  nf_khans.17.t: "[NCR.GetLeader] Accepts Our Request"
  nf_khans.17.d: "[NCR.GetLeader] has accepted our envoy with grace and has allowed us to join [NCR.GetFactionName]. Our common desire for prosperity and peace in the wasteland unite us under a common cause."
  nf_khans.17.a: "Excellent"

  nf_khans.18.t: "[NCR.GetLeader] Rejects Our Request"
  nf_khans.18.d: "[NCR.GetLeader] has rejected our envoys requests to join [CES.GetFactionName] and so we will stand alone, for now."
  nf_khans.18.a: "This is unfortunate"

  nf_khans.19.t: "The Battle for Bittersprings - Field Report"
  nf_khans.19.d: "At [GetDateText] our forces, most notably the 1st Recon unit tracked a large number of Khans to Bittersprings. Upon arrival at the what we believed to be the Khans base of operations we proceeded to send a detachment of troops to advance into Bittersprings whilst the first recon scout snipers prevented them from escaping by the other exit.\n\nThe whole situation was a mess... The major in charge at the time made a bad call - he thought Bitter Springs was full of Great Khan raiders, so we surrounded the place. By the time any of us realized there were civilians down there - women and children - the shooting had already started. The major froze up at the news, and we couldn't get another word out of him.\n\nEnd of Log - [GetDateText]."
  nf_khans.19.a: "We will blame this on bad communications."

  nf_khans.20.t: "Our Future"
  nf_khans.20.d: "The time has finally come for us to decide the future of our people. The only question remaining is who will lead them on this great journey to retake what rightfully belongs to the Khanganate. With the right leadership the Great Khans will surely prosper and bring glory to the names of their forefathers."
  nf_khans.20.a: "Papa Khan will always lead us"
  nf_khans.20.b: "Regis knows what is right"

  nf_khans.21.t: "A Request For Aid"
  nf_khans.21.d: "Not so long ago an envoy from the Great Khans arrived to the audience of our council. They explained that the Great Khans were under threat and that our aid in the war against the Sorrows would be mutually beneficial to both our peoples, allowing for partition of land between what could soon be one of the most powerful alliances in the wasteland. \nShould we accept their request?"
  nf_khans.21.a: "To arms!"
  nf_khans.21.b: "They are on their own..."

  nf_khans.24.t: "Request Refused"
  nf_khans.24.d: "The envoy that we sent to the White Legs has been unsuccessful in convincing them that fighting the Sorrows is within their best interest. This is a major concern and shows the true stance of these dirty dogs."
  nf_khans.24.a: "An unfortunate revelation"
